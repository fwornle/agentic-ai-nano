## Part 1: Understanding LangGraph Architecture (25 minutes)

### The Graph-Based Approach

Traditional agent systems execute linearly:
```

Input → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Output
```


LangGraph enables complex flows:
```

          ┌─→ Agent A ─┐
Input ─→ Decision ─→ Agent B ─→ Synthesis ─→ Output
          └─→ Agent C ─┘
```


### Step 1.1: Core LangGraph Concepts with Enterprise Features

LangGraph has evolved beyond four key components to include enterprise-grade features. Let's start by understanding the enhanced imports for production deployments:

```python
# From src/session3/langgraph_enterprise.py
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END, Send
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, Sequence, Literal
import operator
import asyncio
from datetime import datetime
```

The enhanced imports include:
- **Send API**: For dynamic worker creation in orchestrator patterns
- **MemorySaver/PostgresSaver**: State persistence for production environments
- **asyncio**: For high-performance asynchronous execution

### Advanced State Management (2025)

LangGraph State provides centralized, type-safe, immutable data structures with production features:

```python
# Enhanced State Definition with Production Features
class EnterpriseAgentState(TypedDict):
    # Core workflow data
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]
    current_task: str
    results: dict
    iteration_count: int
    
    # Production features (2025)
    workflow_id: str
    created_at: datetime
    last_updated: datetime
    state_version: int
    
    # Orchestrator-worker pattern support
    active_workers: list[str]
    worker_results: dict[str, dict]
    orchestrator_commands: list[dict]
    
    # Monitoring and observability
    execution_metrics: dict
    error_history: list[dict]
    performance_data: dict
```


**Enhanced State Explained:**

**Core Workflow Data:**
- **messages**: Conversation history that gets accumulated with operator.add
- **current_task**: What the workflow is currently working on
- **results**: Data collected from different agents
- **iteration_count**: Track workflow iterations

**Production Features (2025):**
- **workflow_id**: Unique identifier for state persistence and tracking
- **state_version**: Immutable versioning for state rollback capabilities
- **active_workers**: List of currently running worker nodes
- **worker_results**: Results from orchestrator-spawned workers
- **execution_metrics**: Performance and timing data for monitoring
- **error_history**: Comprehensive error tracking for debugging

**Key Production Benefits:**
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript-like type checking in Python
- **Immutability**: State updates create new versions, enabling rollback
- **Persistence**: State can be saved to PostgreSQL, Redis, or other backends
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics collection for production monitoring

### Step 1.2: Building Production-Ready Graphs

```python
# From src/session3/enterprise_workflow.py
def create_production_workflow():
    """Create a production-ready workflow with persistence and monitoring"""
    
    # Create checkpointer for state persistence
    checkpointer = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(
        "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/langgraph_state"
    )
    
    # Create the graph with enhanced state schema
    workflow = StateGraph(EnterpriseAgentState)
    
    # Add nodes with production capabilities
    workflow.add_node("orchestrator", orchestrator_node)
    workflow.add_node("researcher", research_node)
    workflow.add_node("analyzer", analyze_node)
    workflow.add_node("reporter", report_node)
    workflow.add_node("monitor", monitoring_node)
    
    # Compile with state persistence
    return workflow.compile(
        checkpointer=checkpointer,
        interrupt_before=["orchestrator"],  # Allow manual intervention
        debug=True  # Enable detailed logging
    )
```

### State Persistence Strategies for Production

```python
# Production state persistence patterns
def configure_state_persistence():
    """Configure different persistence strategies"""
    
    # Option 1: PostgreSQL for enterprise deployments
    postgres_saver = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(
        "postgresql://user:pass@host/db"
    )
    
    # Option 2: Redis for high-performance scenarios
    redis_saver = RedisSaver(
        host="redis-cluster.internal",
        port=6379,
        db=0
    )
    
    # Option 3: Memory for development
    memory_saver = MemorySaver()
    
    return {
        "production": postgres_saver,
        "staging": redis_saver,
        "development": memory_saver
    }
```


### Step 1.3: Adding Edges - The Flow Control

```python
# From src/session3/simple_workflow.py (continued)
def configure_workflow_edges(workflow):
    """Configure how nodes connect to each other"""
    
    # Simple sequential edge
    workflow.add_edge("researcher", "analyzer")
    
    # Conditional edge with decision logic
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "analyzer",                    # From this node
        should_continue_analysis,      # Decision function
        {
            "continue": "reporter",    # If continue, go to reporter
            "retry": "researcher",     # If retry, go back to researcher
            "end": END                 # If done, end workflow
        }
    )
    
    # Set starting point
    workflow.set_entry_point("researcher")
```


**Edge Types Explained:**
- **add_edge()**: Always go from A to B
- **add_conditional_edges()**: Go to different nodes based on logic
- **set_entry_point()**: Where the workflow starts

### Step 1.4: Node Implementation

Nodes are functions that process state and return updates. Let's start with a research node that gathers information:

```python
# From src/session3/workflow_nodes.py
def research_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Research node - gathers information"""
    current_task = state["current_task"]
    
    # Simulate research (in practice, call LLM or tools)
    research_result = f"Researched information about: {current_task}"
    
    # Update state
    updated_results = state["results"].copy()
    updated_results["research"] = research_result
    
    return {
        "results": updated_results,
        "messages": state["messages"] + [HumanMessage(content=research_result)]
    }
```

Notice how the research node extracts the current task, performs work, and returns state updates. The key pattern is copying existing state and adding new data rather than replacing everything.

Now let's implement an analysis node that processes the research data:

```python
def analyze_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Analysis node - processes research data"""
    research_data = state["results"].get("research", "")
    
    # Simulate analysis
    analysis_result = f"Analysis of: {research_data}"
    
    # Update state
    updated_results = state["results"].copy()
    updated_results["analysis"] = analysis_result
    
    return {
        "results": updated_results,
        "messages": state["messages"] + [AIMessage(content=analysis_result)]
    }
```


**Node Best Practices:**
- Always return state updates, not full state replacement
- Include error handling for robust workflows
- Keep nodes focused on single responsibilities

### Step 1.3: Orchestrator-Worker Pattern (NEW 2025)

The Send API enables dynamic worker creation, allowing orchestrators to spawn workers with specific inputs:

```python
# From src/session3/orchestrator_worker.py
def orchestrator_node(state: EnterpriseAgentState) -> Command[Literal["research_worker", "analysis_worker"]]:
    """Orchestrator that dynamically creates workers"""
    current_task = state["current_task"]
    
    # Analyze task complexity and spawn appropriate workers
    if "complex research" in current_task.lower():
        # Spawn multiple research workers with different focuses
        return [
            Send("research_worker", {"focus": "technical", "task_id": "tech_1"}),
            Send("research_worker", {"focus": "market", "task_id": "market_1"}),
            Send("research_worker", {"focus": "competitive", "task_id": "comp_1"})
        ]
    elif "analysis" in current_task.lower():
        # Spawn analysis worker with full context
        return Send("analysis_worker", {
            "data": state["results"],
            "task_id": f"analysis_{datetime.now().isoformat()}"
        })
    
    return []  # No workers needed

def research_worker(state: dict) -> dict:
    """Dynamic worker that processes specific research focus"""
    focus = state["focus"]
    task_id = state["task_id"]
    
    # Worker-specific processing based on focus
    if focus == "technical":
        result = perform_technical_research(state)
    elif focus == "market":
        result = perform_market_research(state)
    elif focus == "competitive":
        result = perform_competitive_research(state)
    
    return {
        "worker_results": {
            task_id: {
                "focus": focus,
                "result": result,
                "completed_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
            }
        }
    }
```

### Shared State Accessibility

All nodes in the orchestrator-worker pattern have access to shared state:

```python
def configure_orchestrator_workflow():
    """Configure workflow with orchestrator-worker pattern"""
    
    workflow = StateGraph(EnterpriseAgentState)
    
    # Add orchestrator and worker nodes
    workflow.add_node("orchestrator", orchestrator_node)
    workflow.add_node("research_worker", research_worker)
    workflow.add_node("analysis_worker", analysis_worker)
    workflow.add_node("result_aggregator", aggregate_worker_results)
    
    # Orchestrator spawns workers dynamically
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "orchestrator",
        route_to_workers,  # Routes based on Send commands
        ["research_worker", "analysis_worker"]
    )
    
    # All workers feed back to aggregator
    workflow.add_edge("research_worker", "result_aggregator")
    workflow.add_edge("analysis_worker", "result_aggregator")
    
    workflow.set_entry_point("orchestrator")
    
    return workflow.compile()
```

## Part 2: Advanced Conditional Logic and Complex Routing (25 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Advanced Routing Logic with Complex Conditional Branching

LangGraph 2025 supports sophisticated routing logic with complex conditional branching. Let's start with enterprise-grade decision functions:

```python
# From src/session3/advanced_routing.py
def advanced_routing_decision(state: EnterpriseAgentState) -> str:
    """Advanced decision function with complex conditional logic"""
    
    analysis_result = state["results"].get("analysis", "")
    iteration_count = state.get("iteration_count", 0)
    execution_metrics = state.get("execution_metrics", {})
    error_history = state.get("error_history", [])
    
    # Multi-factor decision making
    quality_score = calculate_quality_score(analysis_result)
    performance_score = execution_metrics.get("performance_score", 0.5)
    error_rate = len(error_history) / max(iteration_count, 1)
    
    # Complex conditional branching
    if quality_score >= 0.9 and performance_score >= 0.8:
        return "high_quality_path"
    elif quality_score >= 0.7 and error_rate < 0.1:
        return "standard_quality_path"
    elif iteration_count < 3 and error_rate < 0.3:
        return "retry_with_improvements"
    elif error_rate >= 0.5:
        return "circuit_breaker_mode"  # Too many errors
    else:
        return "fallback_processing"

def calculate_quality_score(analysis: str) -> float:
    """Calculate quality score based on multiple criteria"""
    if not analysis:
        return 0.0
    
    # Multiple quality metrics
    length_score = min(len(analysis) / 200, 1.0)  # Optimal length
    keyword_score = sum(1 for keyword in ["analysis", "conclusion", "evidence"] 
                       if keyword in analysis.lower()) / 3
    structure_score = 1.0 if analysis.count('\n') >= 2 else 0.5  # Has structure
    
    return (length_score + keyword_score + structure_score) / 3
```

### Continuous and Contextual Processing

LangGraph enables continuous processing across complex workflows with contextual awareness:

```python
def create_contextual_workflow():
    """Workflow with continuous contextual processing"""
    
    workflow = StateGraph(EnterpriseAgentState)
    
    # Context-aware nodes
    workflow.add_node("context_analyzer", analyze_context)
    workflow.add_node("adaptive_processor", process_with_context)
    workflow.add_node("context_updater", update_context)
    workflow.add_node("continuous_monitor", monitor_context_changes)
    
    # Continuous loop with context awareness
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "context_analyzer",
        route_based_on_context,
        {
            "deep_analysis_needed": "adaptive_processor",
            "context_shift_detected": "context_updater",
            "continue_monitoring": "continuous_monitor",
            "processing_complete": END
        }
    )
    
    # Continuous monitoring loop
    workflow.add_edge("continuous_monitor", "context_analyzer")
    workflow.add_edge("context_updater", "context_analyzer")
    workflow.add_edge("adaptive_processor", "context_analyzer")
    
    return workflow.compile()
```

This decision function implements quality control with retry logic. It examines both the content quality and iteration count to prevent infinite loops while ensuring quality results.

Here's another common pattern - routing based on task characteristics:

```python
def route_by_task_type(state: AgentState) -> str:
    """Route to different agents based on task type"""
    current_task = state["current_task"]
    
    if "math" in current_task.lower():
        return "math_specialist"
    elif "research" in current_task.lower():
        return "research_specialist"
    elif "creative" in current_task.lower():
        return "creative_specialist"
    else:
        return "general_agent"
```


### Step 2.2: Advanced Routing Patterns

Let's build a more sophisticated workflow that intelligently routes tasks to specialized agents. First, we'll set up the graph structure:

```python
# From src/session3/advanced_routing.py
def create_intelligent_routing_workflow():
    """Workflow with intelligent task routing"""
    
    workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
    
    # Add specialized agent nodes
    workflow.add_node("task_analyzer", analyze_task_requirements)
    workflow.add_node("math_specialist", handle_math_tasks)
    workflow.add_node("research_specialist", handle_research_tasks)
    workflow.add_node("creative_specialist", handle_creative_tasks)
    workflow.add_node("quality_checker", check_output_quality)
```

This creates our graph with specialized agents for different types of work. The task_analyzer acts as a dispatcher, examining incoming tasks to determine the best specialist.

Now let's configure the routing logic:

```python
    # Start with task analysis
    workflow.set_entry_point("task_analyzer")
    
    # Route based on task type
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "task_analyzer",
        route_by_task_type,
        {
            "math_specialist": "math_specialist",
            "research_specialist": "research_specialist", 
            "creative_specialist": "creative_specialist"
        }
    )
    
    # All specialists go to quality check
    workflow.add_edge("math_specialist", "quality_checker")
    workflow.add_edge("research_specialist", "quality_checker")
    workflow.add_edge("creative_specialist", "quality_checker")
    
    return workflow.compile()
```


### Step 2.3: Quality Control Loops

Quality control is essential for reliable workflows. Let's implement a quality checking node that evaluates work and provides feedback:

```python
# From src/session3/quality_control.py
def check_output_quality(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Quality control node with feedback loop"""
    
    # Get the latest result
    results = state["results"]
    latest_result = list(results.values())[-1] if results else ""
    
    # Simple quality metrics
    quality_score = calculate_quality_score(latest_result)
    
    # Update state with quality assessment
    updated_results = results.copy()
    updated_results["quality_score"] = quality_score
    updated_results["needs_revision"] = quality_score < 0.7
    
    return {
        "results": updated_results,
        "iteration_count": state.get("iteration_count", 0) + 1
    }
```

This node evaluates the quality of work and marks whether revision is needed. It also tracks iteration count to prevent infinite revision loops.

Now we need a decision function to determine the next step based on quality assessment:

```python
def quality_decision(state: AgentState) -> str:
    """Decide if work needs revision"""
    quality_score = state["results"].get("quality_score", 0)
    iteration_count = state.get("iteration_count", 0)
    
    if quality_score >= 0.8:
        return "approved"
    elif iteration_count < 3:
        return "needs_revision"
    else:
        return "max_iterations_reached"
```

## Part 3: Enterprise Parallel Execution and Advanced State Management (30 minutes)

### The Power of Parallel Processing

Instead of sequential processing:
```

Task → Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Result (3x time)
```


LangGraph enables parallel execution:
```

     ┌─→ Agent A ─┐
Task ├─→ Agent B ─┤→ Merge → Result (1x time)
     └─→ Agent C ─┘
```


### Step 3.1: Creating Parallel Nodes

Parallel execution is one of LangGraph's most powerful features. Let's create a workflow that executes multiple research branches simultaneously:

```python
# From src/session3/parallel_workflow.py
def create_parallel_research_workflow():
    """Workflow with parallel research branches"""
    
    workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
    
    # Add parallel research nodes
    workflow.add_node("technical_research", research_technical_aspects)
    workflow.add_node("market_research", research_market_aspects)
    workflow.add_node("competitive_research", research_competitors)
    workflow.add_node("merge_research", merge_parallel_results)
    workflow.add_node("final_analysis", create_final_analysis)
```

These nodes represent different research specializations that can work simultaneously. Each focuses on a specific aspect: technical details, market conditions, and competitive landscape.

Now let's configure the parallel execution and synchronization:

```python
    # All research nodes run in parallel from start
    workflow.set_entry_point("technical_research")
    workflow.set_entry_point("market_research") 
    workflow.set_entry_point("competitive_research")
    
    # All parallel nodes feed into merger
    workflow.add_edge("technical_research", "merge_research")
    workflow.add_edge("market_research", "merge_research")
    workflow.add_edge("competitive_research", "merge_research")
    
    # Final analysis after merge
    workflow.add_edge("merge_research", "final_analysis")
    
    return workflow.compile()
```


### Step 3.2: State Merging Strategies

When parallel branches complete, we need to merge their results intelligently. Here's how to collect and combine parallel execution results:

```python
# From src/session3/state_merging.py
def merge_parallel_results(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Merge results from parallel execution branches"""
    
    results = state["results"]
    
    # Collect results from different research branches
    technical_data = results.get("technical_research", {})
    market_data = results.get("market_research", {})
    competitive_data = results.get("competitive_research", {})
```

This first step extracts the individual results from each parallel branch. Each branch stores its findings in the shared state under its own key.

Now we create a comprehensive merged dataset that combines all insights:

```python
    # Create comprehensive merged result
    merged_research = {
        "technical_insights": technical_data,
        "market_insights": market_data,
        "competitive_insights": competitive_data,
        "merge_timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "data_sources": len([d for d in [technical_data, market_data, competitive_data] if d])
    }
    
    # Update state with merged data
    updated_results = results.copy()
    updated_results["comprehensive_research"] = merged_research
    
    return {
        "results": updated_results,
        "current_task": "analysis_phase"
    }
```


### Step 3.3: Production-Ready Synchronization and API Gateway Integration

2025 LangGraph includes enhanced synchronization patterns for enterprise deployments:

```python
# From src/session3/enterprise_sync.py
class EnterpriseSynchronizedState(TypedDict):
    """Enhanced state with enterprise synchronization features"""
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]
    results: dict
    completion_status: dict  # Track which branches are complete
    required_branches: list  # Which branches must complete
    
    # Enterprise features (2025)
    api_gateway_responses: dict  # Integration with external APIs
    circuit_breaker_status: dict  # Circuit breaker states
    performance_metrics: dict  # Real-time performance data
    dependency_health: dict  # External service health status
```

### API Gateway Integration Patterns

LangGraph 2025 provides built-in patterns for enterprise system connectivity:

```python
def create_api_integrated_workflow():
    """Workflow with API gateway integration"""
    
    workflow = StateGraph(EnterpriseSynchronizedState)
    
    # API integration nodes
    workflow.add_node("api_coordinator", coordinate_api_calls)
    workflow.add_node("external_service_caller", call_external_services)
    workflow.add_node("response_aggregator", aggregate_api_responses)
    workflow.add_node("circuit_breaker_monitor", monitor_service_health)
    
    # Integration with API gateways
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "api_coordinator",
        check_service_availability,
        {
            "services_healthy": "external_service_caller",
            "degraded_mode": "fallback_processing",
            "circuit_open": "cache_response"
        }
    )
    
    return workflow.compile()

def coordinate_api_calls(state: EnterpriseSynchronizedState) -> dict:
    """Coordinate multiple API calls with circuit breaker protection"""
    
    api_calls_needed = determine_api_calls(state["current_task"])
    circuit_status = state.get("circuit_breaker_status", {})
    
    # Filter out calls to services with open circuits
    available_calls = [
        call for call in api_calls_needed 
        if circuit_status.get(call["service"], "closed") != "open"
    ]
    
    return {
        "api_gateway_responses": {
            "planned_calls": available_calls,
            "circuit_blocked": len(api_calls_needed) - len(available_calls)
        }
    }
```

This enhanced state includes completion tracking fields. The `completion_status` tracks which branches have finished, while `required_branches` defines which ones must complete before proceeding.

Here's a decision function that implements synchronization logic:

```python
def wait_for_all_branches(state: SynchronizedState) -> str:
    """Decision function that waits for all parallel branches"""
    
    completion_status = state["completion_status"]
    required_branches = state["required_branches"]
    
    # Check if all required branches are complete
    all_complete = all(
        completion_status.get(branch, False) 
        for branch in required_branches
    )
    
    if all_complete:
        return "proceed_to_next_phase"
    else:
        incomplete = [
            branch for branch in required_branches 
            if not completion_status.get(branch, False)
        ]
        print(f"Waiting for branches: {incomplete}")
        return "wait_for_completion"
```

## Part 4: Enterprise Multi-Agent Patterns with Production Features (35 minutes)

### Step 4.1: The Debate Pattern

Create agents that can debate and reach consensus. First, let's set up the debate workflow structure:

```python
# From src/session3/debate_pattern.py
def create_debate_workflow():
    """Multi-agent debate with consensus building"""
    
    workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
    
    # Add debate participants
    workflow.add_node("proposer", propose_solution)
    workflow.add_node("critic", critique_proposal)
    workflow.add_node("mediator", mediate_debate)
    workflow.add_node("consensus_checker", check_consensus)
```

This creates our debate participants: a proposer who suggests solutions, a critic who challenges them, a mediator who facilitates discussion, and a consensus checker who evaluates agreement.

Now let's configure the debate flow with conditional loops:

```python
    # Debate flow
    workflow.set_entry_point("proposer")
    workflow.add_edge("proposer", "critic")
    workflow.add_edge("critic", "mediator")
    workflow.add_edge("mediator", "consensus_checker")
    
    # Conditional: continue debate or reach conclusion
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "consensus_checker",
        check_debate_completion,
        {
            "continue_debate": "proposer",  # Loop back for another round
            "consensus_reached": END,        # End with agreement
            "impasse": END                   # End without agreement
        }
    )
    
    return workflow.compile()
```

The key insight here is the conditional loop that can send the debate back to the proposer for another round if consensus hasn't been reached.

Here's the decision logic that determines when to end the debate:

```python
def check_debate_completion(state: AgentState) -> str:
    """Determine if debate should continue"""
    iteration_count = state.get("iteration_count", 0)
    consensus_score = state["results"].get("consensus_score", 0)
    
    if consensus_score >= 0.8:
        return "consensus_reached"
    elif iteration_count >= 5:  # Max 5 debate rounds
        return "impasse"
    else:
        return "continue_debate"
```


### Step 4.2: The Review Chain Pattern

Implement a peer review system with multiple reviewers and revision cycles. First, let's set up the review workflow:

```python
# From src/session3/review_chain.py
def create_review_chain_workflow():
    """Multi-stage peer review workflow"""
    
    workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
    
    # Review stages
    workflow.add_node("initial_draft", create_initial_work)
    workflow.add_node("peer_review_1", first_reviewer)
    workflow.add_node("peer_review_2", second_reviewer)
    workflow.add_node("author_revision", handle_revisions)
    workflow.add_node("final_approval", final_review)
```

This creates a comprehensive review pipeline with initial drafting, two peer reviewers, author revision, and final approval stages.

Now let's configure the review process flow with conditional branching:

```python
    # Sequential review process
    workflow.set_entry_point("initial_draft")
    workflow.add_edge("initial_draft", "peer_review_1")
    workflow.add_edge("peer_review_1", "peer_review_2")
    workflow.add_edge("peer_review_2", "author_revision")
    
    # Decision point after revision
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "author_revision",
        revision_quality_check,
        {
            "needs_more_review": "peer_review_1",  # Another review cycle
            "ready_for_approval": "final_approval", # Final approval
            "major_revision_needed": "initial_draft" # Start over
        }
    )
    
    return workflow.compile()
```


### Step 4.3: The Hierarchical Team Pattern

Create supervisor-worker relationships where a supervisor coordinates specialized workers. Let's start with the team structure:

```python
# From src/session3/hierarchical_team.py
def create_hierarchical_workflow():
    """Supervisor coordinates specialized workers"""
    
    workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
    
    # Team structure
    workflow.add_node("supervisor", supervise_team)
    workflow.add_node("data_worker", handle_data_tasks)
    workflow.add_node("analysis_worker", handle_analysis_tasks)
    workflow.add_node("report_worker", handle_reporting_tasks)
    workflow.add_node("quality_assurance", qa_check)
```

This creates a hierarchical structure with one supervisor coordinating three specialized workers, plus a quality assurance step.

Now let's configure the supervision and reporting relationships:

```python
    # Supervisor routes work to appropriate workers
    workflow.set_entry_point("supervisor")
    
    # Conditional routing from supervisor
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "supervisor",
        route_to_worker,
        {
            "data_task": "data_worker",
            "analysis_task": "analysis_worker",
            "report_task": "report_worker",
            "all_complete": "quality_assurance"
        }
    )
    
    # Workers report back to supervisor
    workflow.add_edge("data_worker", "supervisor")
    workflow.add_edge("analysis_worker", "supervisor")
    workflow.add_edge("report_worker", "supervisor")
    
    return workflow.compile()
```

The key pattern here is that all workers report back to the supervisor, creating a central coordination point.

Here's the supervisor node implementation that manages the team:

```python
def supervise_team(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Supervisor node that coordinates team work"""
    current_task = state["current_task"]
    completed_tasks = state["results"].get("completed_tasks", [])
    
    # Determine what work needs to be done
    remaining_work = analyze_remaining_work(current_task, completed_tasks)
    
    # Update state with supervision decisions
    updated_results = state["results"].copy()
    updated_results["supervision_plan"] = remaining_work
    updated_results["next_worker"] = determine_next_worker(remaining_work)
    
    return {
        "results": updated_results,
        "current_task": f"Supervising: {current_task}"
    }
```

## Part 5: Production Error Handling and Enterprise Resilience (25 minutes)

### Step 5.1: Graceful Error Recovery

Robust workflows need comprehensive error handling. Let's build a fault-tolerant workflow structure:

```python
# From src/session3/error_handling.py
def create_fault_tolerant_workflow():
    """Workflow with comprehensive error handling"""
    
    workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
    
    # Main workflow nodes
    workflow.add_node("main_processor", main_processing_node)
    workflow.add_node("error_handler", handle_errors)
    workflow.add_node("retry_logic", retry_failed_operation)
    workflow.add_node("fallback_processor", fallback_processing)
```

This creates specialized nodes for different aspects of error handling: main processing, error handling, retry logic, and fallback processing.

Now let's configure the error handling flow with conditional routing:

```python
    # Normal flow
    workflow.set_entry_point("main_processor")
    
    # Error handling flow
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "main_processor",
        check_for_errors,
        {
            "success": END,
            "recoverable_error": "retry_logic",
            "critical_error": "error_handler",
            "use_fallback": "fallback_processor"
        }
    )
    
    return workflow.compile()
```

This routing logic evaluates the success or failure of the main processor and routes to appropriate error handling strategies.

Here's the centralized error handling node that logs and processes errors:

```python
def handle_errors(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Centralized error handling node"""
    error_info = state["results"].get("error", {})
    error_count = state.get("error_count", 0)
    
    # Log error details
    error_log = {
        "error_type": error_info.get("type", "unknown"),
        "error_message": error_info.get("message", ""),
        "error_count": error_count + 1,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "recovery_attempted": True
    }
    
    # Update state with error information
    updated_results = state["results"].copy()
    updated_results["error_log"] = error_log
    
    return {
        "results": updated_results,
        "error_count": error_count + 1,
        "current_task": "error_recovery"
    }
```


### Step 5.2: Advanced Circuit Breaker Patterns for Enterprise Resilience

2025 LangGraph includes comprehensive circuit breaker patterns for production resilience:

```python
# From src/session3/enterprise_circuit_breaker.py
class CircuitBreakerState:
    """Advanced circuit breaker with multiple failure modes"""
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=300, half_open_max_calls=3):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.half_open_max_calls = half_open_max_calls
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
        self.half_open_calls = 0

def enterprise_circuit_breaker_decision(state: EnterpriseAgentState) -> str:
    """Advanced circuit breaker with comprehensive failure handling"""
    
    error_count = state.get("error_count", 0)
    error_history = state.get("error_history", [])
    dependency_health = state.get("dependency_health", {})
    
    # Analyze different types of failures
    critical_errors = len([e for e in error_history if e.get("severity") == "critical"])
    timeout_errors = len([e for e in error_history if "timeout" in e.get("type", "")])
    network_errors = len([e for e in error_history if "network" in e.get("type", "")])
    
    # Multi-dimensional circuit breaker logic
    if critical_errors >= 2:  # Critical errors have lower threshold
        return "circuit_open_critical"
    elif timeout_errors >= 3:  # Service degradation
        return "circuit_half_open_degraded"
    elif network_errors >= 5:  # Network issues
        return "circuit_open_network"
    elif error_count >= 10:  # General error threshold
        return "circuit_open_general"
    
    # Check dependency health
    unhealthy_deps = sum(1 for health in dependency_health.values() if health < 0.7)
    if unhealthy_deps >= 2:
        return "circuit_open_dependencies"
    
    return "circuit_closed"  # Normal operation

# Comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
def create_resilient_workflow():
    """Workflow with comprehensive error recovery"""
    
    workflow = StateGraph(EnterpriseAgentState)
    
    # Error handling and recovery nodes
    workflow.add_node("main_processor", main_processing_node)
    workflow.add_node("error_classifier", classify_errors)
    workflow.add_node("retry_handler", handle_retries)
    workflow.add_node("circuit_breaker", manage_circuit_breaker)
    workflow.add_node("fallback_processor", fallback_processing)
    workflow.add_node("error_reporter", report_errors)
    workflow.add_node("health_checker", check_system_health)
    
    # Sophisticated error routing
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "main_processor",
        classify_processing_result,
        {
            "success": "health_checker",
            "retryable_error": "retry_handler",
            "circuit_breaker_error": "circuit_breaker",
            "critical_error": "error_reporter",
            "degraded_performance": "fallback_processor"
        }
    )
    
    return workflow.compile()
```

### Workflow Monitoring and Observability Best Practices

```python
# From src/session3/monitoring.py
def monitoring_node(state: EnterpriseAgentState) -> dict:
    """Comprehensive workflow monitoring and observability"""
    
    # Collect execution metrics
    current_time = datetime.now()
    execution_time = (current_time - state["created_at"]).total_seconds()
    
    # Performance metrics
    metrics = {
        "execution_time_seconds": execution_time,
        "nodes_executed": len(state["results"]),
        "error_rate": len(state["error_history"]) / max(state["iteration_count"], 1),
        "worker_utilization": len(state["active_workers"]),
        "state_size_bytes": calculate_state_size(state),
        "memory_usage_mb": get_memory_usage(),
        "cpu_utilization_percent": get_cpu_usage()
    }
    
    # Alert on anomalies
    alerts = []
    if execution_time > 300:  # 5 minutes
        alerts.append({"type": "long_execution", "value": execution_time})
    if metrics["error_rate"] > 0.1:  # 10% error rate
        alerts.append({"type": "high_error_rate", "value": metrics["error_rate"]})
    
    return {
