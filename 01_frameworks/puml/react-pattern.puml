title ReAct Pattern: Reasoning and Acting in Loops

actor "User" as user
participant "ReAct Agent" as agent

user -> agent : "Calculate the compound interest on $10,000 at 5% for 3 years,\nthen find the best savings accounts with higher rates"

activate agent

note over agent : **Observation 1:** User wants compound interest calculation and better rate research

note over agent : **Thought 1:** I need to calculate compound interest first.\nFormula: A = P(1 + r)^t where P=10000, r=0.05, t=3

note over agent : **Action 1:** Use calculator tool
agent -> agent : calculate(10000 * (1 + 0.05)^3)
agent -> agent : Result: $11,576.25

note over agent : **Observation 2:** Compound interest result is $11,576.25\nNow need to research better savings rates

note over agent : **Thought 2:** Need to find current savings account rates.\nShould search for high-yield savings accounts with rates > 5%

note over agent : **Action 2:** Search web for savings rates
agent -> agent : web_search("high yield savings accounts 2024 rates above 5%")
agent -> agent : Found several options: Marcus (4.5%), Ally (4.25%), Capital One (4.35%)

note over agent : **Observation 3:** Current top rates are lower than 5%\nMight need to look at CDs or money market accounts

note over agent : **Thought 3:** Since savings rates are below 5%, should check CDs\nand money market accounts for better options

note over agent : **Action 3:** Search for CD rates
agent -> agent : web_search("best CD rates 2024 12 month certificates deposit")
agent -> agent : Found: Navy Federal (5.25%), PenFed (5.15%), Marcus (5.05%)

note over agent : **Observation 4:** CDs offer rates above 5%\nHave complete information to provide recommendation

agent -> user : **Analysis Results:**\n\nCompound Interest Calculation:\n• Principal: $10,000\n• Rate: 5% annually\n• Time: 3 years\n• **Final Amount: $11,576.25**\n• Interest Earned: $1,576.25\n\n**Better Rate Options:**\nCurrent savings accounts max out around 4.5%,\nbut 12-month CDs offer higher rates:\n• Navy Federal Credit Union: 5.25% APY\n• Pentagon Federal: 5.15% APY\n• Marcus by Goldman Sachs: 5.05% APY\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider a 12-month CD\nfor rates above your current 5% if you can\ncommit funds for the term.

note right of agent : **ReAct Benefits:**\n• Adapts to new information\n• Transparent reasoning process\n• Handles unexpected results\n• Self-correcting behavior\n• Multi-step problem solving
