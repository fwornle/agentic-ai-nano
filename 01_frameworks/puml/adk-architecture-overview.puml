' Agent to Core connections
LA --> R : orchestrates
WA --> R : orchestrates
CA --> R : orchestrates

' Core internal connections
R <--> S : manages state
R <--> E : handles events

' Core to Tools connections
R --> PT : invokes
R --> MT : invokes
R --> TT : invokes

' Agent to Model connections
LA ASYNC_LINE G : inference
LA ASYNC_LINE V : inference
LA ASYNC_LINE L : inference

' Core to Deployment connections
R ..> CR : deploys to
R ..> K8 : deploys to
R ..> VAI : deploys to

note bottom : ADK provides code-first Python framework\nfor building production-ready AI agents
