## **Advanced Multi-Agent Patterns**

### **Consensus-Based Decision Making**
```python
# src/session8/consensus_agents.py
from typing import List, Dict, Any
import asyncio

class ConsensusCoordinator:
    def __init__(self, agents: List[Agent]):
        self.agents = agents
        self.consensus_threshold = 0.7
    
    async def reach_consensus(self, decision_point: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Implement consensus-based decision making"""
        agent_opinions = []
        
        # Collect opinions from all agents
        for agent in self.agents:
            opinion = await agent.evaluate_decision(decision_point)
            agent_opinions.append({
                'agent': agent.name,
                'decision': opinion['decision'],
                'confidence': opinion['confidence'],
                'reasoning': opinion['reasoning']
            })
        
        # Calculate consensus
        return self._calculate_consensus(agent_opinions)
    
    def _calculate_consensus(self, opinions: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Calculate weighted consensus from agent opinions"""
        decision_weights = {}
        for opinion in opinions:
            decision = opinion['decision']
            confidence = opinion['confidence']
            
            if decision not in decision_weights:
                decision_weights[decision] = 0
            decision_weights[decision] += confidence
        
        # Find consensus decision
        total_weight = sum(decision_weights.values())
        consensus_decision = max(decision_weights, key=decision_weights.get)
        consensus_strength = decision_weights[consensus_decision] / total_weight
        
        return {
            'consensus_decision': consensus_decision,
            'consensus_strength': consensus_strength,
            'agent_opinions': opinions,
            'has_consensus': consensus_strength >= self.consensus_threshold
        }
```


### **Advanced ReAct Implementation**
```python
# Sophisticated ReAct with meta-reasoning
class AdvancedReActAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm, tools, max_iterations=15):
        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = tools
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        self.reasoning_history = []
    
    async def solve_complex_problem(self, problem: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Solve complex problems with advanced ReAct reasoning"""
        
        reasoning_chain = []
        current_step = 1
        
        # Initial problem analysis
        thought = await self._analyze_problem_complexity(problem)
        
        while current_step <= self.max_iterations:
            step_result = await self._execute_reasoning_step(
                problem, thought, reasoning_chain, current_step
            )
            
            reasoning_chain.append(step_result)
            
            if step_result['action'] == 'FINAL_ANSWER':
                break
            
            # Meta-reasoning: evaluate reasoning quality
            meta_evaluation = await self._evaluate_reasoning_quality(reasoning_chain)
            
            if meta_evaluation['needs_backtrack']:
                reasoning_chain = await self._backtrack_reasoning(reasoning_chain)
            
            thought = step_result['next_thought']
            current_step += 1
        
        return {
            'problem': problem,
            'reasoning_chain': reasoning_chain,
            'final_answer': reasoning_chain[-1].get('observation', 'No answer found'),
            'reasoning_quality': await self._assess_final_reasoning(reasoning_chain)
        }
    
    async def _evaluate_reasoning_quality(self, chain: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Meta-reasoning to evaluate reasoning quality"""
        if len(chain) < 2:
            return {'needs_backtrack': False}
        
        recent_steps = chain[-3:]  # Look at last 3 steps
        
        # Check for circular reasoning
        actions = [step.get('action') for step in recent_steps]
        if len(set(actions)) == 1 and len(actions) > 1:
            return {'needs_backtrack': True, 'reason': 'circular_reasoning'}
        
        # Check for progress
        observations = [step.get('observation', '') for step in recent_steps]
        if all('error' in obs.lower() for obs in observations):
            return {'needs_backtrack': True, 'reason': 'repeated_errors'}
        
        return {'needs_backtrack': False}
