A) Readiness probe  
B) Startup probe  
C) Both A and B are correct ‚úÖ  
D) Liveness probe only  

**Explanation:** Readiness probes determine when a container is ready to serve traffic, while startup probes handle initial startup delays. Both can be relevant depending on the scenario.

---

### Question 11: GDPR Compliance Requirement
**What is the primary requirement for GDPR compliance in agent systems?**

A) Data encryption only  
B) Valid consent and lawful basis for processing personal data ‚úÖ
