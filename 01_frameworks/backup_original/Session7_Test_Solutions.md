# Session 7: Building Your First ADK Agent - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

### Question 1: Conversation Memory
**What is the primary role of the ConversationMemory class?**

A) Store user preferences  
B) Maintain conversation context and history ‚úÖ  
C) Handle tool integration  
D) Manage cloud deployment  

**Explanation:** ConversationMemory maintains the context and history of conversations, allowing agents to provide contextually relevant responses across multiple interaction turns.

---

### Question 2: Tool Selection
**How does the ADK agent determine when to use MCP tools?**

A) Random selection  
B) User explicitly requests tools  
C) Response analysis and pattern matching ‚úÖ  
D) Fixed rule-based system  

**Explanation:** The agent analyzes user messages for patterns and keywords to intelligently determine when specific MCP tools should be invoked, using confidence-based selection.

---

### Question 3: Async Processing
**What advantage does async processing provide in agent implementations?**

A) Simpler code structure  
B) Better error handling  
C) Non-blocking operations and improved performance ‚úÖ  
D) Easier debugging  

**Explanation:** Async processing allows agents to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently without blocking, significantly improving overall performance and responsiveness.

---

### Question 4: Context Management
**How does the agent maintain context across conversation turns?**

A) Static variables  
B) ConversationMemory with turn tracking ‚úÖ  
C) External database  
D) Cloud storage  

**Explanation:** The ConversationMemory system tracks individual conversation turns with timestamps, roles, and metadata, maintaining context across the entire conversation session.

---

### Question 5: System Prompt
**What is the purpose of the system prompt in agent responses?**

A) User identification  
B) Provide context about available tools and agent capabilities ‚úÖ  
C) Error handling  
D) Performance optimization  

**Explanation:** The system prompt informs the Gemini model about the agent's capabilities, available tools, and operational context, enabling more accurate and helpful responses.
