# Session 9: Multi-Agent Patterns & ReAct - Test Solutions

## Multiple Choice Test Solutions

### Section A: ReAct Pattern Fundamentals (Questions 1-5)

1. **What does ReAct stand for in agent systems?**
   - **Answer: b) Reasoning and Acting**
   - Explanation: ReAct interleaves reasoning (thought) and acting (action) steps for better decision-making

2. **What is the key innovation of the ReAct pattern?**
   - **Answer: b) Interleaving reasoning and action steps**
   - Explanation: ReAct's innovation is combining reasoning traces with action execution for improved performance

3. **Which component tracks ReAct execution history?**
   - **Answer: c) Thought Chain**
   - Explanation: The thought chain maintains the history of reasoning and action steps

4. **How does ReAct handle complex multi-step problems?**
   - **Answer: b) Decompose and reason about each step**
   - Explanation: ReAct breaks down problems and reasons about each step before acting

5. **What is the purpose of "observations" in ReAct?**
   - **Answer: b) Feedback from action execution**
   - Explanation: Observations provide feedback from actions to inform subsequent reasoning

### Section B: Coordination Patterns (Questions 6-10)

6. **Which coordination pattern uses voting mechanisms?**
   - **Answer: b) Consensus-based coordination**
   - Explanation: Consensus patterns use voting to achieve agreement among agents

7. **What is the primary benefit of hierarchical planning?**
   - **Answer: b) Task decomposition and abstraction**
   - Explanation: Hierarchical planning enables complex task breakdown into manageable subtasks

8. **How do auction mechanisms work in multi-agent systems?**
   - **Answer: b) Bid-based resource allocation**
   - Explanation: Agents bid for resources or tasks based on their capabilities and costs

9. **What is Byzantine fault tolerance designed to handle?**
   - **Answer: b) Malicious or faulty agents**
   - Explanation: Byzantine fault tolerance handles agents that may act maliciously or incorrectly

10. **Which pattern is best for emergent behavior?**
    - **Answer: b) Stigmergic coordination**
    - Explanation: Stigmergic coordination through environmental modification enables emergent behaviors

### Section C: Planning and Reasoning (Questions 11-15)

11. **What is hierarchical task decomposition?**
    - **Answer: b) Breaking tasks into subtask hierarchies**
    - Explanation: HTN planning decomposes high-level tasks into structured subtask hierarchies

12. **How does contingency planning improve robustness?**
    - **Answer: b) Alternative paths for failures**
    - Explanation: Contingency plans provide fallback strategies when primary plans fail

13. **What is meta-reasoning in agent systems?**
    - **Answer: b) Reasoning about reasoning quality**
    - Explanation: Meta-reasoning evaluates and improves the quality of reasoning processes

14. **Which planning algorithm uses state-space search?**
    - **Answer: b) STRIPS planning**
    - Explanation: STRIPS uses state-space search with preconditions and effects

15. **What is the role of heuristics in planning?**
    - **Answer: b) Guide search toward promising paths**
    - Explanation: Heuristics provide guidance to make search more efficient

### Section D: Consensus and Negotiation (Questions 16-20)

16. **What is required for Byzantine consensus?**
    - **Answer: b) More than 2/3 honest agents**
    - Explanation: Byzantine consensus requires more than 2/3 of agents to be honest

17. **Which voting method prevents strategic manipulation?**
    - **Answer: b) Borda count with verification**
    - Explanation: Borda count with verification mechanisms reduces strategic voting

18. **What is a Nash equilibrium in multi-agent systems?**
    - **Answer: b) No agent benefits from unilateral change**
    - Explanation: Nash equilibrium is a state where no single agent can improve by changing strategy alone

19. **How do negotiation protocols handle deadlock?**
    - **Answer: b) Timeout and escalation mechanisms**
    - Explanation: Timeouts and escalation procedures break negotiation deadlocks

20. **What is Pareto optimality?**
    - **Answer: b) No improvement without harming others**
    - Explanation: Pareto optimal solutions cannot be improved without making some agent worse off

### Section E: Production Implementation (Questions 21-25)

21. **Which pattern ensures scalability in multi-agent systems?**
    - **Answer: b) Distributed coordination with local decisions**
    - Explanation: Distributed coordination with local decision-making scales better than centralized control

22. **How should agent communication be implemented for reliability?**
    - **Answer: b) Message queues with acknowledgments**
    - Explanation: Message queues with acknowledgments ensure reliable, asynchronous communication

23. **What monitoring is critical for multi-agent systems?**
    - **Answer: b) Agent health, consensus metrics, coordination efficiency**
    - Explanation: Comprehensive monitoring of agent health, consensus, and coordination is essential

24. **How do you handle agent failures in production?**
    - **Answer: b) Redundancy and automatic failover**
    - Explanation: Redundancy with automatic failover ensures system resilience

25. **What is essential for debugging distributed agent systems?**
    - **Answer: b) Distributed tracing with correlation IDs**
    - Explanation: Distributed tracing with correlation IDs enables tracking across agent interactions
