# Session 10: Enterprise Integration & Production Deployment - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

### Question 1
**What is the primary challenge in enterprise agent integration?**

A) Code complexity  
B) Connecting with legacy systems and ensuring security ‚úÖ  
C) Performance optimization  
D) User interface design  

**Explanation:** Enterprise integration primarily involves connecting with existing legacy systems while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

### Question 2
**Which pattern is most effective for ERP system integration?**

A) Direct database access  
B) Adapter pattern with OAuth 2.0 authentication ‚úÖ  
C) File-based integration  
D) Screen scraping  

**Explanation:** The adapter pattern provides a clean interface to ERP systems while OAuth 2.0 ensures secure enterprise authentication.

### Question 3
**What is the main benefit of multi-stage Docker builds for agent deployment?**

A) Faster builds  
B) Reduced image size and improved security ‚úÖ  
C) Better documentation  
D) Easier debugging  

**Explanation:** Multi-stage builds separate build dependencies from runtime, resulting in smaller, more secure production images.

### Question 4
**How should you handle secrets and credentials in production deployments?**

A) Environment variables  
B) Encrypted secret management systems with rotation ‚úÖ  
C) Configuration files  
D) Code comments  

**Explanation:** Production systems require encrypted secret management with automatic rotation and secure access controls.

### Question 5
**What is the purpose of health checks in production agent systems?**

A) Performance monitoring only  
B) Comprehensive system and dependency validation ‚úÖ  
C) User authentication  
D) Cost optimization  

**Explanation:** Health checks validate the entire system including dependencies, ensuring the agent is ready to handle requests.

### Question 6
**Which deployment strategy minimizes downtime during updates?**

A) All-at-once deployment  
B) Rolling updates with health checks ‚úÖ  
C) Maintenance windows  
D) Manual deployment  

**Explanation:** Rolling updates deploy changes incrementally with health checks, ensuring zero downtime deployments.

### Question 7
**What is the most important aspect of enterprise security for agents?**

A) Password complexity  
B) Zero-trust architecture with encryption and audit logging ‚úÖ  
C) VPN access  
D) Firewall rules  

**Explanation:** Enterprise security requires zero-trust architecture with comprehensive encryption, audit logging, and access controls.

### Question 8
**How should you approach monitoring in enterprise agent systems?**

A) Log files only  
B) Comprehensive observability with metrics, traces, and alerts ‚úÖ  
C) Manual monitoring  
D) Error counting  

**Explanation:** Enterprise monitoring requires comprehensive observability including metrics, distributed tracing, and intelligent alerting.

### Question 9
**What makes Kubernetes suitable for enterprise agent deployment?**

A) Simple configuration  
B) Auto-scaling, self-healing, and enterprise orchestration ‚úÖ  
C) Low cost  
D) Better performance  

**Explanation:** Kubernetes provides auto-scaling, self-healing capabilities, and enterprise-grade orchestration features needed for production agents.

### Question 10
**Which approach is best for handling enterprise agent failures?**

A) Immediate restart  
B) Circuit breakers, graceful degradation, and compensation patterns ‚úÖ  
C) Manual intervention  
D) System shutdown  

**Explanation:** Enterprise failure handling requires circuit breakers, graceful degradation, and compensation patterns to maintain system reliability.
