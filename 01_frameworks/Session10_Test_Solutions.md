   - **Answer: c) Multi-factor authentication with certificate-based auth**
   - Explanation: Provides the highest security level with multiple verification factors

3. **What role does a service mesh play in enterprise agent deployments?**
   - **Answer: b) Traffic management, security, and observability**
   - Explanation: Service mesh provides comprehensive communication control

4. **How does RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) enhance security in agent systems?**
   - **Answer: b) By providing fine-grained permissions based on user roles**
   - Explanation: RBAC ensures users have appropriate access levels

5. **What is the primary benefit of using multi-stage Docker builds for agents?**
   - **Answer: b) Smaller final image size and improved security**
   - Explanation: Multi-stage builds separate build and runtime dependencies

### Deployment & Orchestration (Questions 6-10)

6. **Which Kubernetes deployment strategy provides zero-downtime updates?**
   - **Answer: d) Both b and c are correct** (Rolling updates and Blue-green deployments)
   - Explanation: Both strategies can achieve zero downtime with different approaches

7. **What is the purpose of health probes in Kubernetes deployments?**
   - **Answer: b) Automatic failure detection and recovery**
   - Explanation: Health probes enable Kubernetes to automatically manage container health

8. **How does CI/CD improve enterprise agent deployment?**
   - **Answer: c) Integrated security scanning and vulnerability assessment**
   - Explanation: Security must be integrated throughout the pipeline

9. **What role does Helm play in Kubernetes deployments?**
   - **Answer: b) Parameterized and reusable deployment templates**
   - Explanation: Helm enables consistent deployments across environments

10. **Which probe type should you use to determine if a container is ready to serve traffic?**
    - **Answer: c) Both a and b are correct** (Readiness and startup probes)
    - Explanation: Different probe types serve different purposes

### Security & Compliance (Questions 11-15)

11. **What is the primary requirement for GDPR compliance in agent systems?**
    - **Answer: b) Valid consent and lawful basis for processing personal data**
    - Explanation: GDPR requires explicit consent and legal justification

12. **Which encryption strategy is recommended for sensitive data in enterprise systems?**
    - **Answer: b) Asymmetric encryption with key rotation**
    - Explanation: Provides strong security with manageable key lifecycle

13. **What is the purpose of data classification in enterprise environments?**
    - **Answer: b) Applying appropriate security controls based on data sensitivity**
    - Explanation: Classification drives security policy application

14. **How does the principle of least privilege enhance security?**
    - **Answer: b) Users get only minimum permissions needed for their role**
    - Explanation: Minimizes potential security exposure

15. **What is the significance of audit logs in compliance frameworks?**
    - **Answer: b) Providing evidence of compliance and supporting incident investigation**
    - Explanation: Audit logs are essential for compliance proof

### Monitoring & Performance (Questions 16-20)

16. **Which metric type is most appropriate for tracking the number of API requests?**
    - **Answer: b) Counter**
    - Explanation: Counters are designed for monotonically increasing values like request counts

17. **What is the primary benefit of distributed tracing in multi-agent systems?**
    - **Answer: b) Understanding request flow across multiple services**
    - Explanation: Distributed tracing provides end-to-end visibility

18. **How do SLA violations typically trigger automated responses?**
    - **Answer: b) Through alert rules and escalation policies**
    - Explanation: Automated response systems handle SLA violations consistently

19. **What factors should influence auto-scaling decisions in enterprise environments?**
    - **Answer: b) Multiple metrics including CPU, memory, queue length, and response time**
    - Explanation: Comprehensive metrics provide better scaling decisions

20. **Which caching strategy provides the best performance for frequently accessed data?**
    - **Answer: b) Multi-level caching with intelligent eviction policies**
    - Explanation: Provides optimal performance with efficient resource usage
