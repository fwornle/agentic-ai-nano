# Session 4: CrewAI Team Orchestration
## Hierarchical Multi-Agent Teams and Role-Based Collaboration

### ðŸŽ¯ **Session Overview**
CrewAI provides an intuitive framework for building hierarchical multi-agent teams where agents have specific roles, collaborate on shared tasks, and follow structured workflows. This session explores team-based agent orchestration patterns.

### ðŸ“š **Learning Objectives**
1. **Master CrewAI architecture** with agents, tasks, and crews
2. **Design role-based agent teams** with clear responsibilities and hierarchies
3. **Implement collaborative workflows** with task delegation and coordination
4. **Create production-ready crews** with monitoring and error handling
5. **Compare team-based vs graph-based** multi-agent approaches

## **CrewAI Architecture**

### **Core Components**
```python
# src/session4/crewai_basics.py
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from crewai.tools import SerperDevTool, WebsiteSearchTool

# Define specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    role='Senior Research Analyst',
    goal='Conduct thorough research on assigned topics',
    backstory="""You are a senior research analyst with expertise in 
    gathering and analyzing information from multiple sources.""",
    tools=[SerperDevTool(), WebsiteSearchTool()],
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False
)

writer = Agent(
    role='Content Writer',
    goal='Create compelling, well-structured content',
    backstory="""You are a skilled content writer who transforms 
    research into engaging, informative content.""",
    tools=[],
    verbose=True
)

# Define tasks
research_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest trends in AI agent frameworks",
    agent=researcher,
    expected_output="Comprehensive research report with key findings"
)

writing_task = Task(
    description="Write a blog post based on the research findings",
    agent=writer,
    expected_output="Well-structured blog post with actionable insights"
)

# Create crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=2
)
```

### **Advanced Team Patterns**
```python
# Hierarchical team structure
class AdvancedCrewSystem:
    def __init__(self, llm):
        self.llm = llm
        self.crews = self._create_specialized_crews()
    
    def create_analysis_crew(self):
        # Data analyst
        analyst = Agent(
            role='Senior Data Analyst',
            goal='Analyze data and extract insights',
            backstory="Expert in statistical analysis and data interpretation",
            tools=[CalculatorTool(), DataVisualizationTool()]
        )
        
        # Quality reviewer  
        reviewer = Agent(
            role='Quality Assurance Specialist',
            goal='Review and validate analysis results',
            backstory="Meticulous reviewer ensuring accuracy and completeness",
            allow_delegation=True
        )
        
        # Manager/coordinator
        manager = Agent(
            role='Analysis Team Lead',
            goal='Coordinate analysis workflow and ensure quality',
            backstory="Experienced team lead with strong project management skills",
            allow_delegation=True
        )
        
        return Crew(
            agents=[analyst, reviewer, manager],
            tasks=self._create_analysis_tasks(),
            process=Process.hierarchical,
            manager_llm=self.llm
        )
```
