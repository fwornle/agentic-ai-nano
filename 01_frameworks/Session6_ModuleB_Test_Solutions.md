### Question 3: Enterprise Monitoring Metrics
A) CPU usage only  
B) ✅ Response times, success rates, error patterns, and resource utilization  
C) Memory consumption only  
D) Network bandwidth  

**Correct Answer: B) Response times, success rates, error patterns, and resource utilization**

**Explanation**: The enterprise monitoring system tracks comprehensive performance metrics including response times for SLA compliance, success rates for reliability analysis, error patterns for issue identification, and resource utilization for capacity planning.

### Question 4: Alert Management System
A) Silent logging only  
B) ✅ Configurable alerting with severity levels and notification channels  
C) Email notifications only  
D) No alerting mechanism  

**Correct Answer: B) Configurable alerting with severity levels and notification channels**

**Explanation**: The AlertManager provides sophisticated alerting capabilities with configurable severity levels for different types of issues, multiple notification channels for different stakeholders, and intelligent alert routing based on escalation policies.

### Question 5: Enterprise Deployment Strategies
A) Single deployment mode  
B) ✅ Blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rolling updates with health checks  
C) Manual deployment only  
D) Development environment only  

**Correct Answer: B) Blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rolling updates with health checks**

**Explanation**: The enterprise system supports multiple deployment strategies including blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates, canary releases for gradual rollouts with risk mitigation, and rolling updates with comprehensive health checks for production safety.
