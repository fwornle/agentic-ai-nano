# Session 7 Module B - Test Solutions

## Enterprise Agent Systems - Answer Key

### Question 1: Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategy
A) Blue-green deployments with traffic switching  
B) Manual server restart  
C) ✅ Rolling updates with Kubernetes orchestration and canary deployment capability  
D) Single instance deployment  

**Correct Answer: C) Rolling updates with Kubernetes orchestration and canary deployment capability**

**Explanation**: The enterprise system uses rolling updates with Kubernetes orchestration for zero-downtime deployments, combined with canary deployment capabilities that allow gradual traffic shifting and risk mitigation during updates.

### Question 2: Load Balancer Traffic Routing
A) Random distribution  
B) ✅ Health-based routing with weighted distribution and canary traffic management  
C) First-available agent  
D) Round-robin only  

**Correct Answer: B) Health-based routing with weighted distribution and canary traffic management**

**Explanation**: The load balancer implements intelligent traffic routing based on agent health status, supports weighted distribution for performance optimization, and provides canary traffic management for safe deployment rollouts.

### Question 3: Enterprise Security Controls
A) Basic authentication only  
B) ✅ Role-based access control, audit logging, and compliance policy enforcement  
C) No security controls  
D) Manual authorization  

**Correct Answer: B) Role-based access control, audit logging, and compliance policy enforcement**

**Explanation**: The SecurityManager implements comprehensive enterprise security including role-based access control for granular permissions, audit logging for compliance tracking, and automated policy enforcement for security governance.

### Question 4: Observability System Features
A) Basic logging only  
B) ✅ Distributed tracing, structured logging, metrics collection, and SLO management  
C) Manual monitoring  
D) Error logs only  

**Correct Answer: B) Distributed tracing, structured logging, metrics collection, and SLO management**

**Explanation**: The enterprise observability stack provides comprehensive monitoring with distributed tracing for request flow analysis, structured logging for searchable insights, metrics collection for performance tracking, and SLO management for service quality assurance.

### Question 5: Auto-Scaling Response Mechanism
A) Manual scaling only  
B) ✅ CPU and memory-based horizontal pod autoscaling with custom metrics  
C) Fixed instance count  
D) Manual load balancing  

**Correct Answer: B) CPU and memory-based horizontal pod autoscaling with custom metrics**

**Explanation**: The auto-scaling system responds to load changes through horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU and memory utilization, enhanced with custom metrics for application-specific scaling decisions and optimal resource utilization.
