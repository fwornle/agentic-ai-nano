### üéØ **Module Overview**
This self-paced 2-week module provides comprehensive instruction on building production-ready AI agents using 2025 state-of-the-art frameworks and implementing the five core agentic patterns: Reflection, Tool Use, ReAct, Planning, and Multi-Agent Collaboration. Through hands-on tutorials and progressive implementation, you'll master cutting-edge agent development with performance breakthroughs (CrewAI 5.76x faster execution), enterprise production capabilities, and modern protocol standardization (MCP, A2A, ACP, ANP). You'll develop skills to create intelligent, adaptable agents using both bare-metal approaches and established frameworks optimized for 2025 production environments.
