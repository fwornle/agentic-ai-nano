## Enterprise Team Patterns - Answer Key

### Question 1: Enterprise Search Tool Architecture
**Correct Answer: b) Knowledge base (1.2 weight) and databases (1.3 weight)**

**Explanation**: The source weighting system prioritizes trusted enterprise data sources:
```python
source_weights = {
    "knowledge_base": 1.2,  # Higher weight for internal sources
    "web": 1.0,
    "documents": 1.1,
    "databases": 1.3
}
```

This weighting ensures that internal documentation and database content receive priority over external web sources, maintaining enterprise data quality standards.

### Question 2: Delegation Authority Hierarchy
**Correct Answer: d) ENTERPRISE_LEAD**

**Explanation**: The delegation rules define strategic planning as an enterprise-level responsibility:
```python
DelegationRule(
    from_authority=DelegationAuthority.ENTERPRISE_LEAD,
    to_authority=DelegationAuthority.DEPARTMENT_MANAGE,
    task_types=["strategic_planning", "resource_allocation", "policy_creation"],
    conditions={"complexity": ">= 0.8", "impact": "enterprise"},
    resource_limits={"budget": 1000000, "personnel": 50},
    approval_required=False,
    escalation_path=["board_approval"]
)
```

Only enterprise leaders have the authority to delegate strategic planning tasks, ensuring appropriate organizational oversight.

### Question 3: Workload Validation
**Correct Answer: b) Alternative agents are suggested without escalation required**

**Explanation**: The capacity validation system provides alternatives when agents are overloaded:
```python
if not workload_check["has_capacity"]:
    return {
        "can_delegate": False,
        "reason": f"Target agent overloaded: {workload_check['reason']}",
        "alternative_agents": workload_check.get("alternatives", []),
        "requires_escalation": False
    }
```

This approach maintains workflow efficiency by suggesting viable alternatives rather than blocking delegation entirely.

### Question 4: Resource Limit Validation
**Correct Answer: c) Any resource limit violation according to delegation rules**

**Explanation**: Resource validation checks all limits defined in delegation rules:
```python
resource_check = self._validate_resource_limits(applicable_rules[0], task_context)

if not resource_check["within_limits"]:
    return {
        "can_delegate": False,
        "reason": f"Resource limits exceeded: {resource_check['violations']}",
        "requires_escalation": True,
        "escalation_path": applicable_rules[0].escalation_path
    }
```

Any violation of defined resource limits (budget, personnel, time) triggers escalation through the appropriate hierarchy.

### Question 5: Performance Monitoring
**Correct Answer: b) Every 5 minutes with 1-minute retry on errors**

**Explanation**: The background monitoring system uses structured intervals:
```python
# Sleep for monitoring interval
threading.Event().wait(300)  # Check every 5 minutes

except Exception as e:
    self.logger.error(f"Performance monitoring error: {str(e)}")
    threading.Event().wait(60)  # Retry after 1 minute
```

This frequency balances system responsiveness with resource efficiency, providing timely alerts while minimizing overhead.
