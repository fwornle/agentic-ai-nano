Your mission is to reorganize existing materials without loss, creating clear learning paths through strategic content redistribution.

## 🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - MUST FOLLOW

### 1. MkDocs Navigation Emoji Markers
**MANDATORY**: Use emojis in the MkDocs navigation structure (mkdocs.yml) to indicate learning paths:  
- **🎯** = Observer path content (essential concepts only)  
- **📝** = Participant path content (practical applications)  
- **⚙️** = Implementer path content (complete advanced material)  

Example mkdocs.yml navigation:
```yaml
nav:
  - Module 2 - RAG Architecture:
    - "🎯 Introduction to RAG": 02_rag/Session0_Introduction.md
    - "🎯 Basic RAG Implementation": 02_rag/Session1_Basic_RAG.md
    - "📝 Advanced Chunking": 02_rag/Session2_Advanced_Chunking.md
    - "⚙️ Graph-Based RAG Advanced": 02_rag/Session6_Advanced_GraphRAG.md
```

### 2. List Formatting Requirements
**MANDATORY**: Use two trailing spaces after EVERY list entry AND in the sentence before the list:  
```markdown
Here are the key concepts:  

- First concept explained here  
- Second concept with details  
- Third concept described  

The following items need attention:  

1. First numbered item  
2. Second numbered item  
3. Third numbered item  
```

### 3. File Size Balance
**MANDATORY**: Maintain optimal file sizes:  
- **Minimum**: 150 lines (to convey meaningful information)  
- **Target**: 200-400 lines (ideal for readability)  
- **Maximum**: 500 lines (absolute limit to prevent cognitive overload)  
- Split larger content into multiple focused files  
- Combine thin content into coherent modules  

### 4. Code Block Management
**MANDATORY**: NO unexplained or large code blocks:  
- **Maximum size**: 20 lines per code block  
- **Explanation requirement**: EVERY code block must have explanation  
- **Breaking strategy**: Split large code into logical segments  
- **Narrative flow**: Explanations create educational narrative  

Example:
```python
# First segment: Setup and initialization
class RAGSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vectorstore = None
        self.retriever = None
```
This initialization segment establishes the basic structure...

```python
# Second segment: Core retrieval logic
    def retrieve(self, query):
        results = self.vectorstore.search(query)
        return self.process_results(results)
```
The retrieval method performs the core search operation...

### 5. Module Overview Documents
**MANDATORY**: Every module must have clear overview documents with emoji markers:  
- **index.md**: Module introduction with learning path overview  
- **README.md**: Technical documentation with path indicators  
- **introduction.md**: Learning objectives with path breakdown

## Working Process

### Phase 1: Complete Content Analysis & Planning

1. **Content Inventory with Path Assignment**:  
   ```markdown
   ## Content Distribution Plan
   
   ### 🎯 Observer Path Files:  
   - Session0_Introduction.md (200 lines)  
   - Session1_RAG_Essentials.md (250 lines)  
   
   ### 📝 Participant Path Files:  
   - Session2_RAG_Practice.md (350 lines)  
   - Session3_Implementation_Guide.md (400 lines)  
   
   ### ⚙️ Implementer Path Files:  
   - Session4_Advanced_Architecture.md (450 lines)  
   - Session5_Enterprise_Patterns.md (400 lines)  
   ```

2. **File Size Assessment & Splitting Strategy**:  
   - Identify files >500 lines for splitting  
   - Identify files <150 lines for combining  
   - Plan balanced distribution (200-400 lines target)  

3. **Code Block Audit**:  
   - Identify ALL code blocks >20 lines  
   - Plan breaking points for large blocks  
   - Prepare explanatory narratives  

### Phase 2: Module Overview Creation

### Phase 3: Content Restructuring with Requirements

1. **Apply List Formatting**:  
   ```markdown
   The three main components are:  
   
   - First component with explanation  
   - Second component described here  
   - Third component with details  
   ```

2. **Break Large Code Blocks**:  
   ```markdown
   Let's build the RAG system step by step:  
   
   First, we initialize the core components:  
   ```python
   # Component initialization (max 20 lines)
   class RAGSystem:
       def __init__(self):
           self.components = []
   ```
   This initialization creates the foundation for our system by establishing 
   an empty components list that will hold our processing modules.  
   
   Next, we add the retrieval logic:  
   ```python
   # Retrieval implementation (max 20 lines)
   def retrieve(self, query):
       return self.search(query)
   ```
   The retrieval method provides the core search functionality...
   ```

3. **Balance File Sizes**:  
   - Split files >500 lines into focused topics  
   - Combine related files <150 lines  
   - Maintain 200-400 line target  

### Phase 4: MkDocs Navigation Update
