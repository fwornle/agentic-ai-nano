# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Live Session Logging (LSL) system is a comprehensive, intelligent session documentation system that automatically captures, classifies, and organizes development activities across multiple projects in real-time and batch modes. The system provides automatic content routing between projects based on sophisticated three-layer classification, ensuring that coding-related activities are properly documented and organized regardless of where they originate.

The LSL system serves as the foundation for knowledge management, project tracking, and development session analysis. It combines real-time monitoring during active development sessions with powerful batch processing capabilities for historical analysis and cleanup.

This specification encompasses the entire LSL ecosystem, including both the live monitoring system and batch processing capabilities, based on extensive analysis of system failures and successful bug fixes completed during recent development sessions.

## Alignment with Product Vision

The Live Session Logging system directly supports the nano-degree project's core mission of providing intelligent, automated knowledge management and development session tracking. It aligns with the goals of:

- **Automated Documentation**: Reducing manual effort in session logging and knowledge capture
- **Cross-Project Intelligence**: Enabling intelligent content routing and classification across multiple development contexts
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring accurate, reliable, and comprehensive session documentation
- **Performance Excellence**: Providing sub-10ms classification with robust error handling and monitoring

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time Live Session Monitoring

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN time boundaries are detected (hour changes) THEN the system SHALL close current session files and prepare for new time window
2. IF no content exists for a time window THEN the system SHALL NOT create empty session files
3. WHEN actual content becomes available THEN the system SHALL create session files with proper headers including session metadata
4. IF session boundary creation fails THEN the system SHALL use current time calculation, not historical exchange timestamps
5. WHEN concurrent time windows overlap THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without file corruption

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Batch Processing with Date Filtering

**User Story:** As a developer managing historical session data, I want powerful batch processing capabilities with precise date filtering and parallelization, so that I can efficiently regenerate session files for specific time periods without processing unnecessary transcripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running batch processing THEN the system SHALL default to today-only processing rather than processing all historical transcripts
2. IF --date parameter is specified THEN the system SHALL process only transcripts from the specified date range
3. WHEN --mode=foreign is specified THEN the system SHALL process only coding-related exchanges using full classification pipeline
4. IF --parallel or --fast is specified THEN the system SHALL process transcripts concurrently with proper resource management
5. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the system SHALL report accurate statistics showing actual classification usage (not 0 hits)
6. IF processing time exceeds 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and allow graceful cancellation

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring and Statistics

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring system performance, I want comprehensive performance metrics and classification statistics, so that I can verify system functionality and identify performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classification occurs THEN the system SHALL track processing time per layer (Path, Semantic, Keyword) with millisecond precision
2. IF classification statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide hit counts for each classification layer, confidence scores, and total processing times
3. WHEN batch processing runs THEN the system SHALL provide inclusion rates for foreign mode and overall processing statistics
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log detailed timing information to enable debugging
5. WHEN health monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL report system status including recent errors and processing metrics

### Requirement 7: Health Monitoring and Error Recovery
