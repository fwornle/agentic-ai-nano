**What You'll Learn:**
- Bare metal agent implementation patterns
- LangChain and LangGraph workflow orchestration
- CrewAI team-based agent coordination
- PydanticAI type-safe agent development
- Atomic Agents modular architecture
- ADK (Agent Development Kit) integration
- Agno production-ready deployment
- Multi-agent coordination patterns
- Enterprise integration strategies

### 🔍 Module 2: RAG Architecture (10 Sessions)
Build sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems for enterprise applications.

**What You'll Learn:**
- RAG architecture fundamentals and evolution
- Advanced chunking and preprocessing strategies
- Vector database optimization techniques
- Query enhancement and context augmentation
- RAG evaluation and quality assessment
- Graph-based RAG implementations
- Agentic RAG systems
- Multi-modal RAG architectures
- Production deployment and enterprise integration

## 🚀 Learning Paths

Each session offers **three distinct learning paths** to accommodate different learning styles and time commitments:

### 👀 Observer Path (30-50 min)
