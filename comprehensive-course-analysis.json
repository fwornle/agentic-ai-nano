The DataCatalog serves as the central registry that creates a comprehensive, searchable inventory of all data sources including their schemas, metadata, business context, and usage patterns, enabling efficient data discovery and detailed impact analysis for system changes. DataLineageTracker maintains detailed maps of how data flows and transforms through RAG pipelines from source systems through embeddings to final responses, which is essential for regulatory compliance (proving data provenance), debugging performance issues, and understanding the impact of upstream data changes. DataQualityMonitor implements continuous validation of data integrity, completeness, accuracy, and freshness using automated checks and thresholds, which is critical for maintaining RAG system accuracy and preventing degraded user experiences from poor-quality data. This comprehensive governance foundation prevents organizational data silos, ensures regulatory compliance across multiple frameworks, and maintains consistent data quality standards throughout the entire enterprise RAG ecosystem.",

AuditAutomation manages continuous compliance verification through scheduled assessments, real-time monitoring, and automated evidence collection, replacing manual compliance checks that are often inconsistent and resource-intensive. RiskAssessment continuously evaluates compliance posture by analyzing control effectiveness, identifying compliance gaps, and quantifying regulatory risk exposure to enable proactive remediation. ComplianceReporter generates comprehensive documentation including compliance status dashboards, regulatory filing reports, and audit evidence packages that meet examiner expectations and reduce the burden of compliance reporting. EvidenceCollector automatically captures and preserves compliance artifacts including system logs, configuration snapshots, and control execution records, ensuring that audit trails are complete, tamper-evident, and readily accessible for regulatory examinations.",

Processing frameworks independently prevents conflicts between different regulatory requirements while ensuring each framework receives dedicated attention to its unique controls and reporting requirements. For example, a healthcare organization might implement GDPR and HIPAA engines simultaneously, while a financial services company might combine SOX, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001 engines. Each framework's dedicated engine instance handles regulation-specific nuances such as GDPR's consent management requirements, HIPAA's minimum necessary standards, or SOX's segregation of duties controls.
