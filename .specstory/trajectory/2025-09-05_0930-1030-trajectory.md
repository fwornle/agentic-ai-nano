## Project Mission & Context

### What This Project Achieves
A 6-week nanodegree covering advanced AI agent development, from core patterns through cutting-edge protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A) and production deployment.

### Core Components
- Module 01: Agent Frameworks & Patterns (LangChain, CrewAI, PydanticAI, Atomic Agents, Agno)
- Module 02: RAG Systems (NodeRAG, reasoning-augmented retrieval, multimodal)
- Module 03: Agent Protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A for distributed architectures)
- Three-path learning system: Observer, Participant, Implementer

### Success Metrics
- Course content quality and comprehensiveness
- Educational material accessibility and engagement
- Image attribution and copyright compliance
- Documentation site functionality and navigation

## Current Session Analysis

### Session Evolution
The Comprehensive Agentic AI Educational Curriculum project continues to evolve, with the current session focusing on refining session logging and transcript management to ensure continuity and verifiability of educational content. We are addressing previous issues with session IDs and transcript filenames to enhance the user experience and maintain the integrity of the course material. As we progress, the emphasis remains on developing a robust 6-week nanodegree that covers advanced AI agent development, ensuring that the modules on Agent Frameworks, RAG Systems, and Agent Protocols are comprehensive and accessible to learners across the three-path learning system.

### Project Status Assessment
