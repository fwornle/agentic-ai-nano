## Project Mission & Context

### What This Project Achieves
A 6-week nanodegree covering advanced AI agent development, from core patterns through cutting-edge protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A) and production deployment.

### Core Components
- Module 01: Agent Frameworks & Patterns (LangChain, CrewAI, PydanticAI, Atomic Agents, Agno)
- Module 02: RAG Systems (NodeRAG, reasoning-augmented retrieval, multimodal)
- Module 03: Agent Protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A for distributed architectures)
- Three-path learning system: Observer, Participant, Implementer

### Success Metrics
- Course content quality and comprehensiveness
- Educational material accessibility and engagement
- Image attribution and copyright compliance
- Documentation site functionality and navigation

## Current Session Analysis

### Session Evolution
The Comprehensive Agentic AI Educational Curriculum project continues to advance, with the recent session focusing on enhancing the documentation through the creation of PlantUML diagrams for the LSL system. This effort aligns with our mission to provide a comprehensive nanodegree, ensuring that the educational materials are both accessible and engaging. The successful generation of these diagrams marks a significant step towards improving the course content's quality and comprehensiveness, particularly in Module 03 on Agent Protocols. Moving forward, the project will prioritize the integration of these diagrams into the curriculum and continue refining the three-path learning system to cater to different learner types.
