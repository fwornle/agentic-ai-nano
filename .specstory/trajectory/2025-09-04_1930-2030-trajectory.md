## Session Analysis

### Focus Area
Trajectory analysis and semantic processing

### Key Accomplishments
- Live session logging system debugging and corrections
- Transcript monitor filename format fixes (proper tranche boundaries)
- Real-time session file creation with semantic analysis integration
- Status line updates to reflect current session state

### Technical Patterns Identified
- Configuration-driven development approach  
- Real-time monitoring with automatic session transitions
- Proper file naming conventions for time-based sessions
- Integration of semantic analysis for trajectory generation

## Pattern Recognition

### Successful Approaches
1. **Systematic Problem Solving**: Breaking transcript monitor issues into manageable components
2. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate logging and status line updates
3. **Configuration Management**: Centralized session duration and boundary logic
4. **Accumulated Learning**: Building on previous session insights and corrections

### Emerging Guardrails
1. **Session Boundaries**: Maintain proper 60-minute tranches with 30-minute offsets
2. **File Naming**: Use consistent YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM-session.md format
3. **Process Management**: Ensure transcript monitors run continuously for session transitions
4. **Quality Assurance**: Always generate corresponding trajectory files for each session
