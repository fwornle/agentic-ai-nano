## Project Mission & Context

### What This Project Achieves
A 6-week nanodegree covering advanced AI agent development, from core patterns through cutting-edge protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A) and production deployment.

### Core Components
- Module 01: Agent Frameworks & Patterns (LangChain, CrewAI, PydanticAI, Atomic Agents, Agno)
- Module 02: RAG Systems (NodeRAG, reasoning-augmented retrieval, multimodal)
- Module 03: Agent Protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A for distributed architectures)
- Three-path learning system: Observer, Participant, Implementer

### Success Metrics
- Course content quality and comprehensiveness
- Educational material accessibility and engagement
- Image attribution and copyright compliance
- Documentation site functionality and navigation

## Current Session Analysis

### Session Evolution
The project continues to evolve with a focus on enhancing the educational curriculum for agentic AI. Recent sessions have highlighted the need for better session logging and prompt extraction, which are critical for maintaining the integrity and continuity of the learning modules. We are addressing these technical issues to ensure that the curriculum remains comprehensive and accessible. Moving forward, the emphasis will be on refining the three-path learning system to better cater to different learner engagement levels, ensuring that the Observer, Participant, and Implementer paths are clearly defined and effectively implemented.

### Project Status Assessment
