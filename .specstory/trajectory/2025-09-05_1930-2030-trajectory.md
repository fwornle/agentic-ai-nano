## Project Mission & Context

### What This Project Achieves
A 6-week nanodegree covering advanced AI agent development, from core patterns through cutting-edge protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A) and production deployment.

### Core Components
- Module 01: Agent Frameworks & Patterns (LangChain, CrewAI, PydanticAI, Atomic Agents, Agno)
- Module 02: RAG Systems (NodeRAG, reasoning-augmented retrieval, multimodal)
- Module 03: Agent Protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A for distributed architectures)
- Three-path learning system: Observer, Participant, Implementer

### Success Metrics
- Course content quality and comprehensiveness
- Educational material accessibility and engagement
- Image attribution and copyright compliance
- Documentation site functionality and navigation

## Current Session Analysis

### Session Evolution
The Comprehensive Agentic AI Educational Curriculum project continues to evolve, with a recent focus on revisiting earlier successful implementations of live session logging. This regression to a previously working solution underscores the project's commitment to maintaining high-quality educational content and user experience. The team is now realigning efforts to ensure the nanodegree's modules, particularly those involving MCP and agent protocols, are both comprehensive and functional, aiming to enhance the learning paths for Observers, Participants, and Implementers alike. This strategic pivot is expected to bolster the course's success metrics, especially in terms of content quality and engagement.

### Project Status Assessment
