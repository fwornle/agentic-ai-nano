## Project Mission & Context

### What This Project Achieves
A 6-week nanodegree covering advanced AI agent development, from core patterns through cutting-edge protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A) and production deployment.

### Core Components
- Module 01: Agent Frameworks & Patterns (LangChain, CrewAI, PydanticAI, Atomic Agents, Agno)
- Module 02: RAG Systems (NodeRAG, reasoning-augmented retrieval, multimodal)
- Module 03: Agent Protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A for distributed architectures)
- Three-path learning system: Observer, Participant, Implementer

### Success Metrics
- Course content quality and comprehensiveness
- Educational material accessibility and engagement
- Image attribution and copyright compliance
- Documentation site functionality and navigation
