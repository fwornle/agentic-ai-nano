## Project Mission & Context

### What This Project Achieves
A 6-week nanodegree covering advanced AI agent development, from core patterns through cutting-edge protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A) and production deployment.

### Core Components
- Module 01: Agent Frameworks & Patterns (LangChain, CrewAI, PydanticAI, Atomic Agents, Agno)
- Module 02: RAG Systems (NodeRAG, reasoning-augmented retrieval, multimodal)
- Module 03: Agent Protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A for distributed architectures)
- Three-path learning system: Observer, Participant, Implementer

### Success Metrics
- Course content quality and comprehensiveness
- Educational material accessibility and engagement
- Image attribution and copyright compliance
- Documentation site functionality and navigation

## Current Session Analysis

### Session Evolution
The Comprehensive Agentic AI Educational Curriculum project continues to evolve strategically. Recent sessions have focused on enhancing course material through PNG image analysis for attribution verification, ensuring compliance with copyright standards. The project has also addressed system failures in transcript monitoring, improving session boundary detection to maintain educational continuity. Moving forward, the emphasis will be on refining the three-path learning system—Observer, Participant, Implementer—to enhance learner engagement and educational outcomes. The integration of advanced agent protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A) into the curriculum remains a priority, aiming to equip learners with cutting-edge skills in distributed AI architectures.

### Project Status Assessment
