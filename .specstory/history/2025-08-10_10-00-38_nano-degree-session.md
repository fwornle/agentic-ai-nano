The logs show the semantic analysis server is running but there's no visible memory service. Let me check the MCP configuration and status more thoroughly:

The memory server appears to be configured but not providing any resources. Let me check if we can still access the knowledge through the shared-memory files:

The memory connection failure appears to be with the MCP memory server. The issue is that while the memory server is configured in the MCP configuration, it's not starting properly or connecting. This is a known issue where the memory server package might not be installed or accessible.

**Summary:**
The MCP memory service failed to connect/start. This appears to be because:
1. The `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` package is timing out when trying to run
2. The memory server is configured but not providing any resources

**Workaround:**
The knowledge base is still accessible through the shared-memory JSON files directly (`shared-memory-coding.json`, etc.), though without the MCP memory server's query capabilities.

To fix this, you may need to:
1. Reinstall the memory server: `npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`
2. Or update the MCP configuration to use a different memory service implementation
3. Or rely on the file-based knowledge storage for now
