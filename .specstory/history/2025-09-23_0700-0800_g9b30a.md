**User Request:** so, in QUALITY_REPORT.md you for instance tell me that there is this issue:\
5-agent-patterns.png - Referenced in Session 1 ❌

Location: Session1_Bare_Metal_Agents.md:224
Action: Create PlantUML diagram showing the 5 agentic patterns\
... but then, when I go to line 224 in this file, I see \
**Implementation File**: [`src/session1/reflection_agent_course.py`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/blob/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session1/reflection_agent_course.py)\
--> nothing to do with 5-agent-pattern.png\
... seems that your report is not working. Ultrathink and produce a proper report that reliably helps me fix issues. Also, when I click the link in the report, I don't get to the md-file (source in editor), but to the rendered version... and not to line 224

**Tool:** Grep
**Input:** ```json
{
  "pattern": "5-agent-patterns\\.png",
  "output_mode": "content",
  "-n": true
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** I deleted a lot of the status reports you produced earlier, as it is unclear what is outdated and what is current info. Think. Analyze these md-files in this repo: README.md, docs/*.md, docs-content/*.md) and find all broken links (to images, references, nav links). Update (= rewrite) QUALITY_REPORT.md, to show all issues. I want clickable links that take me directly to the location of the broken link. You tried to do this, but failed (the click led me to the right document but the reported issue wasn't in that line and wasn't an issue anyway --> be thorough and double check that the reported issues are truly problems).\
Also update the image-reference-guide.md (with the tumbnails) - at present, a lot of the listed image links in this document don't work (anymore).

### Edit - 2025-09-23 05:13:47 UTC [07:13:47 CEST]

**User Request:** I deleted a lot of the status reports you produced earlier, as it is unclear what is outdated and what is current info. Think. Analyze these md-files in this repo: README.md, docs/*.md, docs-content/*.md) and find all broken links (to images, references, nav links). Update (= rewrite) QUALITY_REPORT.md, to show all issues. I want clickable links that take me directly to the location of the broken link. You tried to do this, but failed (the click led me to the right document but the reported issue wasn't in that line and wasn't an issue anyway --> be thorough and double check that the reported issues are truly problems).\
Also update the image-reference-guide.md (with the tumbnails) - at present, a lot of the listed image links in this document don't work (anymore).
