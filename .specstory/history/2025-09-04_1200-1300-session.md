**Assistant:** Perfect! Now it makes logical sense:

- **Observer Path**: 2-3 sessions per day (short 30-50 min sessions) = higher frequency, less time per session
- **Participant Path**: 1 session per day (medium 60-90 min sessions) = moderate frequency and time
- **Implementer Path**: 1 session every 2-3 days (long 120-180 min sessions) = lower frequency, more time per session

The progression now correctly shows that as the sessions get longer and more intensive, you do them less frequently. Thank you for catching my mistake!
