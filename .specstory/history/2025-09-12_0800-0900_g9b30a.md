**User Message:** now, update the docs in coding to fully reflect the current system. Remove old content - we don't need to know that there was a V1, V2, V3, V4... just the current state of the logging system. Be concise but complete. Re-create all pumls (and create new ones if needed) using the habitual styling rules (eg. our own coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml file), turn pumls (in puml) to png's (in images), include those in the md's. Make sure the md's of the logging system follow the same style as used...
