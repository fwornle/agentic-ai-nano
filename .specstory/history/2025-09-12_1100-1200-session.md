## Key Activities

### 11:09:53 - Exchange 1

**Assistant:** Perfect! The cleanup was successful. All the remaining files now use the correct 30-minute boundary format:

✅ **Cleaned up successfully:**
- ❌ Removed: `1000-1100`, `1100-1200` (incorrect hour-based format)
- ✅ Kept: `0930-1030`, `1030-1130`, `1000-1030`, `1100-1130` (correct 30-minute boundary format)

The current files now correctly reflect the LSL system's proper time windowing:
- `0730-0830` (7:30-8:30)
- `0800-0830` (8:00-8:30) 
- `0830-0930` (8:30-9:30)
- `0900-0930` (9:00-9:30)
- `0930-1030` (9:30-10:30) ✅ **Today's main session**
- `1000-1030` (10:00-10:30)
- `1030-1130` (10:30-11:30) ✅ **Current session**
- `1100-1130` (11:00-11:30)

The erroneous `11-12` files have been cleaned up from both projects, and the LSL system is now using the correct time format throughout!

### 11:19:55 - Exchange 2

**Assistant:** Now I need to update the line that calculates the time window for display. The status line should show the short format (like "11-12") instead of the full format:
