## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-09 14:02:53 UTC [16:02:53 CEST]

**User Message:** add a podcast feature to the published MkDocs version, so that the main text (md-files) can be listened to in the car

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-09 14:16:27 UTC [16:16:27 CEST]

**User Message:** Looks like there's a formatting issue (when scrolling up, the podcast sidbar overlaps the main toolbar, see: [Image #1]. In addition, I cannot select any voices (would like a bavarian english) and volume and speed cannot be modulated. All in all, the controls seem not fully functional. It would also be good, if I could record some lines in my own voice and use this for the podcast. Fix
