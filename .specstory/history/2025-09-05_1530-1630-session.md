**Claude Response:** The redirect status file exists and shows redirecting to "coding" but it's from over 2 hours ago (11:09), so it would no longer be considered active (5-minute window). The issue is that the live session logging system should be creating fresh redirect status entries as coding content is being proces...

**Claude Response:** The 1530-1630 file is from yesterday, not today. There should be a 2025-09-05_1530-1630 file being created today. The issue is that the enhanced transcript monitor is not running and creating the LSL files in real-time.

**Claude Response:** The problem is clear now:

1. **No real-time monitoring**: The enhanced transcript monitor is not actively running and monitoring the current session
2. **Stale redirect status**: The redirect status file is 2+ hours old so not considered "active"
3. **Missing LSL files**: No 1530-1630 session file ...

**Request:** you just created a trajectory file in the history folder - correct the logic that made this mistake. In addition, check if all transcripts which should have been redirected today have landed in the corrsponding LSL (from-nano-degree.md) files in coding. I suspect, we have not captured everything, since the monitor wasn't running for a few hours

**Request:** I have been at it all afternoon - working from within nano-degree on (exclusively) coding related issues. Check the last few transcripts of nano-degree and find all work that's been done since the late morning. All of this should go to appropriate LSL files in coding (_from-nano-degree.md) --> double check and make sure nothing got lost. Also, the status bar has returned to 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋1553_TBD  --> why? analyse and fix. This must work robustly!
