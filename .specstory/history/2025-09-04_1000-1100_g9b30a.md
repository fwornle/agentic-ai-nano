**User Message:** still not - for example, the test in https://fwornle.github.io/agentic-ai-nano/01_frameworks/Session1_Bare_Metal_Agents/ ... here the solution back link leads to https://fwornle.github.io/agentic-ai-nano/01_frameworks/Session1_ModuleA_Advanced_Agent_Patterns/#multiple-choice-test-session-1. Perform a thorough review of ALL tests across ALL md-files in the ENTIRE degree. To be fixed: (1) The tests MUST be the second-to-last chapter (also not the case in the above example, where chapter "⚙️ Advanc...

**User Message:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this extensive conversation about fixing test structure and navigation issues across an entire course:

1. **Initial Request**: User identified two critical issues: (1) sidebar content not fully reflecting chapter structure, stopping after "Quick Navigation" with larger gaps, and (2) solution back links not pointing to correct test l...

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-04 08:24:35 UTC [10:24:35 CEST]

**User Message:** there often are a number of random chapters between the main text of a session (/an optional session module) and the concluding tests (prior to navigation), eg.: [Image #1] --> Getting Started and Next Steps, Key Takeaways, Additional Resources, Practical Exercise. This clutters the sidebar menu --> collect all of these chapters between the end of the main text and the test in a standard chapter called Discussion. Revise ALL md-files and fix as necessary

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-04 08:27:35 UTC [10:27:35 CEST]

**User Message:** missing solution link: https://fwornle.github.io/agentic-ai-nano/01_frameworks/Session7_First_ADK_Agent. Also, do not use the sub-agents for the chapter review. I want you to go file-by-file (for ALL md-files of the course). Check if there are sections to be collected under Discussion and then do it. While you are at it, verify that each test has a solution link and that the corresponding solution matches the test and that the back link works

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-04 08:47:10 UTC [10:47:10 CEST]

**User Message:** why are there two navigation entries in file https://fwornle.github.io/agentic-ai-nano/01_frameworks/Session7_ADK_Essentials/#navigation (with different emojis. Review all md-files of the course and produce a chapter overview as well as link collection per file. Collect this data in a json file. Then analyze this file to detect such problems in a structured way. At the end of this exercise there shall be no more broken links (404 or wrong target) and there shall be no more double chapters, the e...
