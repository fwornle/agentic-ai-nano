## Session Overview

This session captures real-time tool interactions and exchanges.

## Key Activities

### 11:08:01 - Exchange 1

**Assistant:** I need to also track the origin project in the exchange object, then use it in the filename generation:

---

### 11:08:20 - Exchange 2

**Assistant:** Found it! Now I need to pass the origin project to the filename pattern:

---

### 11:30:05 - Exchange 3

**Assistant:** Perfect! The PNG files are now in the correct location (puml directory) and the markdown reference has been updated to point to the correct path. The issue has been resolved:

1. **Problem**: PNG files were missing from the puml directory where PlantUML would normally generate them
2. **Root Cause**: The original PNG files were in the images directory, but should be in puml directory to match the PlantUML workflow
3. **Solution**: 
   - Copied PNG files from `images/` to `puml/` directory
   - Updated the markdown reference from `images/mcp-inspector-interface.png` to `puml/mcp-inspector-interface.png`

The mcp-inspector PNG issue is now fixed - all files are in their proper locations and references have been corrected.

### 11:40:18 - Exchange 4

**Assistant:** I also need to fix the one file that has a different pattern (line 3):

---

### 11:55:50 - Exchange 5

**User:** now, the statusLine shows  8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴1030-1130(ended)  . You just corrected the display of ->connected from a "valid for 60 minutes" approach to a dynamic "live info" approach. Also apply this to the window info (which, by now, is grossly outdated - it's 11:56!!)

**Assistant:** You're absolutely right! The status line is showing `📋🔴1030-1130(ended)` when it's currently 11:56, which means we're in the 1130-1230 window. The session time display logic needs to be updated to show current/live information, just like I fixed the redirect indicator.
