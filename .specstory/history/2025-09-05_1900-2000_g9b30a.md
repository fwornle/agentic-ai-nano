## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:09:57 UTC [19:09:57 CEST]

**User Message:** file code-block-analysis.json seems to suggest that none of the png's are screenshots - fix this detection by reducing these non-screenshots to the png's which do not have an associated puml file

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:10:32 UTC [19:10:32 CEST]

**User Message:** [Request interrupted by user for tool use]

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

---

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:12:11 UTC [19:12:11 CEST]

**User Message:** there should never be an images folder in puml - find the files that are in such a folder and move them to images... then update the md-files which referenced these puml/images files.

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:14:36 UTC [19:14:36 CEST]

**User Message:** what are all those PostToolUse warnings for? ⏺ PostToolUse:Bash [node /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/scripts/tool-interaction-hook-wrapper.js] failed with non-blocking status code 1: No tool 
  interaction data received

⏺ Now let me look at the current detection script to understand how it detects screenshots:

⏺ Read(scripts/detect-large-code-blocks.py)
  ⎿  Read 183 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:16:05 UTC [19:16:05 CEST]

**User Message:** try to do 2

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

---

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:19:20 UTC [19:19:20 CEST]

**User Message:** why are you redirecting all of the prompts in this discussion to coding? Only the last one (and this very one here) should have been re-directed. Seems that the "re-direct" isn't working. Which is puzzling, because the first few produced artifacts in this project here and NOT in coding --> this should have been enough to set re-direct to false!! Check the logic again and use this file-based filter as the main indicator!

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

---

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:24:03 UTC [19:24:03 CEST]

**User Message:** unsure if this is the right way of looking at this:   This means:
  - ✅ When working in nano-degree/, it will correctly identify as NON-CODING regardless of file extensions
  - ✅ When working in coding/, it will correctly identify as CODING
  - ✅ Generic file extensions only trigger coding detection as a fallback when there's no clear project context\
--> rewrite the detection logic and make it dead simple: when a prompt leads to the touching of artifacts in coding (read, write, modify) then re-...

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:26:58 UTC [19:26:58 CEST]

**User Message:** update the docs to reflect this simplification - remove all no longer needed detection elements (incl. diagram changes / removal... as needed)

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

---

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:35:31 UTC [19:35:31 CEST]

**User Message:** no images / pumls need adjusting? Also check, if the clearly nano-degree related first few prompts have been misguided to coding and should have been created in a LSL file in nano-degree. If found to be the case - fix this

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

---

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:40:43 UTC [19:40:43 CEST]

**User Message:** why are there "No context" entries again? We fixed the LSL entry generating code and this is the only one that should ever be used, regardless of whether you created this automatically during the session or manually during a correction such as this one

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:47:19 UTC [19:47:19 CEST]

**User Message:** now, look over the transcript in nano-degree from 16:00 on and add the entries to the correct LSL/traj. files (to be created if missing) in both coding as well as nano-degree... depending on whether or not it should be classified as coding/nano-degree. Make sure that, as so many times this afternoon, we use the same code we always use to create the entries in the right format and in the correct files. Once the LSL have been reconstructed correctly, run the scripts that generate the corresponding...

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:49:32 UTC [19:49:32 CEST]

**User Message:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all technical details, user requests, and my actions:

1. **Initial Request**: User pointed out that the PNG screenshot detection logic was incorrectly classifying all PNGs as screenshots, when many are actually generated from PlantUML files and should be excluded.

2. **First Major Issue Discovery**: Use...

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:50:20 UTC [19:50:20 CEST]

**User Message:** why did you place items from 2025-09-03 in a LSL file 2025-09-05?! Correct the generating script and run again: 2025-09-03 17:40:52 UTC)

**User Message:**

yes, of course - but... we had this working. Check the very first few iterations of the live session logging and the mcp-constraing-monitor repo from yesterday / the day before. It captured the content... live. Full tool calls and results, summarized after a Groq call (I believe) - why did we move so far away from a mostly working solution?!...

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 17:52:08 UTC [19:52:08 CEST]

**User Message:** no, you don't need to investigate what was actually working before... just the date thing and then re-run the creation of the LSL files from 4pm this afternoon on. I am rejecting your changes to the LSL files in nano-degree, as you screwed up the date thing.
