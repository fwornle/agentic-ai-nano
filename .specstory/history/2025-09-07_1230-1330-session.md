**Request:** fair - but, if my prompt does not mention coding, yet you determine that to answer my request/question you have to read a coding based file, would this lead to ->coding being displayed?

**Request:** then we need to improve/modify the approach - if we go back to finding coding-files in your responses too, is there a way to distinguish the ones that get triggered by the sheer redirection detection? Where can I see the raw response that got written to the transcript file when I asked about the modules in nano-degree?

**Request:** but then revert your latest change to the detection logic. You told me that, although my question (how many modules in nano-degree) had no coding relevance, the system generated ones that followed did have coding-file references... hence you kept the ->coding on. But, if I look at the actual transcript that should have been the input to this detection, I see no coding-reference whatsoever:   âŽ¿ === USER ===                                                                                           ...

**Request:** by the way, while ->coding briefly came on shortly after I had triggered the last prompt, it went off again... although you're still working on files in coding. Presumably, you changed directory to ~/Agentic/coding (see the subsequent tasks "Read(docs/live-session-logging-system.md") - if this is the case, our logic would have to track CD actions in order to properly interpret file paths and not take ->coding back prematurely. After a CD into the coding file tree, everything is coding related un...

**Request:** so, now the ->coding was off although you claimed to continue your work on the coding/docs. As soon as I pressed ESC to tell you this, the ->coding came on. So, it seems that, while the logic works, it might need to trigger an update of the statusLine on a regular basis? Can this be done via a hook, maybe? Or is there still an issue with the way the statusLine script gets called?
