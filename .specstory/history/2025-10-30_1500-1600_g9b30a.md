### User

Warmup

### Assistant

I'm ready to assist you with file search and code exploration tasks in the nano-degree project. I can help you:

- **Find files** using glob patterns and directory navigation
- **Search code** using grep with regex patterns
- **Read and analyze** specific file contents
- **Explore the codebase** structure and architecture

The project is located at `/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree` and is a clean git repository on the main branch.

What would you like me to search for or explore?
