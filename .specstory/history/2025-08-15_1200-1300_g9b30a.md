**User Request:** but I don't want to add a "coding" startup script (simple or not) to every repo where I use the coding system. Without this local startup script we found the globally available script coding/bin/coding (as ./install.sh of coding sets a path variable or an alias which let's you find "coding" from anywhere). Can you not instead do a "pwd" to figure out where coding is currently running from and then use this info instead of having to create a project specific "coding" command in every repo in which we want to use coding?

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [

      "content": "Remove the unnecessary local coding script from nano-degree",

**User Request:** but I don't want to add a "coding" startup script (simple or not) to every repo where I use the coding system. Without this local startup script we found the globally available script coding/bin/coding (as ./install.sh of coding sets a path variable or an alias which let's you find "coding" from anywhere). Can you not instead do a "pwd" to figure out where coding is currently running from and then use this info instead of having to create a project specific "coding" command in every repo in which we want to use coding?

### Read - 2025-08-18 17:49:22 UTC [19:49:22 CEST]

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- All sessions are logged locally in the current project's .specstory/history directory
- For multiple sessions, start with most recent and work backwards
- Focus on understanding the project context and previous work completed
