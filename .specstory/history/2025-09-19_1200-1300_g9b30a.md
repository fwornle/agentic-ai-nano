### TodoWrite - 2025-09-19 10:28:44 UTC [12:28:44 CEST]

**User Request:** this link is still there (public mode): [Image #1] - leads to 404. And in CN mode, the images still don't show + the URL seems to be pointing to the encrypted file ([Image #2]) but even clicking it, does not bring the image to light. Clicking the non-encrypted links (eg. Coder Architecture) brings up the correct image from the regular part of the repo. However, this should be embedded images, not links - presumably a format issue in the underlying coder-details.md

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Remove Session 10 link from Session 9 in public mode",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "activeForm": "Removing Session 10 link from Session 9 in public mode"
    },
    {
      "content": "Fix markdown-to-HTML conversion for images",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Fixing markdown-to-HTML conversion for images"
    },
    {
