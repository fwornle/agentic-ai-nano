### TodoWrite - 2025-08-28 17:09:11 UTC [19:09:11 CEST]

**User Request:** Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file, which will be given to future instances of Claude Code to operate in this repository.
            
What to add:
1. Commands that will be commonly used, such as how to build, lint, and run tests. Include the necessary commands to develop in this codebase, such as how to run a single test.
2. High-level code architecture and structure so that future instances can be productive more <USER_ID_REDACTED>. Focus on the "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand

Usage notes:
- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, suggest improvements to it.
- When you make the initial CLAUDE.md, do not repeat yourself and do not include obvious instructions like "Provide helpful error messages to users", "Write unit tests for all new utilities", "Never include sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in code or commits" 
- Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered
- Don't include generic development practices
- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include the important parts.
- If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts. 
- Do not make up information such as "Common Development Tasks", "Tips for Development", "Support and Documentation" unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.
- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:

```
# CLAUDE.md

  "content": "# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n\n## Repository Overview\n\nThis is the **Agentic AI Nano-Degree** repository - a comprehensive 6-week educational program covering advanced AI agent development, RAG systems, and agent communication protocols. The repository contains **course content, documentation, and practical implementations** rather than a traditional software application.\n\n## Course Architecture\n\n### Three-Module Structure\n- **Module 01 (01_frameworks/)**: Agent Frameworks & Patterns (LangChain, CrewAI, PydanticAI, etc.)\n- **Module 02 (02_rag/)**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems  \n- **Module 03 (03_mcp-acp-a2a/)**: Agent Communication Protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A)\n\n### Learning Path System\nThe course uses a **three-path learning approach**:\n- **👀 Observer Path** (30-80 min): Conceptual understanding\n- **🙋‍♂️ Participant Path** (50-110 min): Guided implementation  \n- **🛠️ Implementer Path** (120-260 min): Full hands-on development\n\n### Session Structure Pattern\nEach session follows this consistent structure:\n1. **Learning Outcomes** - Clear objectives and skills\n2. **Core Content** - Essential concepts with implementations\n3. **Optional Modules** - Advanced topics and production considerations\n4. **📝 Assessment** - Multiple choice tests with solutions\n5. **🧭 Navigation** - Clear progression paths\n\n## Documentation System\n\n### MkDocs Configuration\nThe repository uses **MkDocs with Material theme** for documentation:\n\n**Build Documentation:**\n```bash\nmkdocs serve          # Local development server on port 8000\nmkdocs build          # Build static site\nmkdocs gh-deploy      # Deploy to GitHub Pages\n```\n\n**Setup Documentation Environment:**\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt   # Install MkDocs dependencies\n```\n\n### Content Organization\n- **`docs-content/`**: Main documentation source files\n- **`mkdocs.yml`**: MkDocs configuration with full navigation structure\n- **`site/`**: Generated documentation output\n- **`includes/mkdocs.md`**: Shared markdown snippets\n\n## Development Environment\n\n### Cloud-First Architecture\nThe course is designed for **cloud development environments (Coder)**:\n- Pre-configured workspaces with all dependencies\n- GPU access for AI workloads  \n- Integrated AI coding assistants\n- Zero local installation requirements\n\n### Local Development (Alternative)\nFor each module session, dependencies are managed separately:\n```bash\n# Module 01 example\npip install -r docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session1/requirements.txt\n\n# Module 02 example  \npip install -r docs-content/02_rag/src/session1/requirements.txt\n\n# Module 03 example\npip install -r docs-content/03_mcp-acp-a2a/src/session1/requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Content Standards & Conventions\n\n### Formatting Standards\n- **Multiple Choice Tests**: Use `## 📝 Multiple Choice Test` heading format\n- **Navigation Sections**: Use `## 🧭 Navigation` heading format  \n- **Learning Paths**: Use consistent emojis (👀 Observer, 🙋‍♂️ Participant, 🛠️ Implementer)\n- **Test Solutions**: Follow standardized format with explanations and correct answers marked with ✅\n\n### Code Block Standards\n- **Maximum 20 lines per code block** for educational clarity\n- **Language specification required** for all code blocks (e.g., `python`, `bash`, `yaml`)\n- **Clear explanations** before and after each code segment\n- **Production-ready examples** with proper error handling and documentation\n\n### Assessment Format\nMultiple choice questions follow this exact template:\n```markdown\n**Question 1:** What is the primary benefit of LangChain's unified LLM interface?  \nA) Lower cost  \nB) Consistent API across different LLM providers ✅  \nC) Faster response times  \nD) Better performance  \n\n**Explanation:** LangChain's primary strength is providing a consistent API that works across different LLM providers...\n\n---\n```\n\n## Architecture Patterns\n\n### Educational Content Architecture\n- **Progressive Complexity**: Each session builds on previous knowledge\n- **Modular Design**: Core sessions + optional deep-dive modules\n- **Multi-Path Learning**: Same content, different engagement levels\n- **Assessment-Driven**: Comprehensive testing validates understanding\n\n### Technical Implementation Architecture  \n- **Framework Agnostic**: Covers multiple AI frameworks and approaches\n- **Production Focus**: Real-world deployment patterns and enterprise considerations\n- **Protocol Integration**: Modern communication standards (MCP, ACP, A2A)\n- **Hands-On Learning**: Extensive source code examples and practical exercises\n\n### Source Code Organization\nEach module follows consistent structure:\n```\ndocs-content/[module]/\n├── SessionX_Topic.md           # Core session content\n├── SessionX_ModuleY_Advanced.md # Optional advanced modules  \n├── SessionX_Test_Solutions.md   # Assessment solutions\n├── src/sessionX/               # Implementation code\n│   ├── requirements.txt        # Session-specific dependencies\n│   └── *.py                   # Python implementations\n├── images/                     # Visual assets and diagrams\n└── puml/                      # PlantUML architecture diagrams\n```\n\n## Common Development Tasks\n\n### Content Maintenance\n```bash\n# Validate markdown formatting (if markdownlint available)\nmarkdownlint docs-content/**/*.md\n\n# Update test solution formatting across all modules  \n# (Custom scripts available for bulk formatting updates)\n\n# Generate PlantUML diagrams (if needed)\n# Convert .puml files in module puml/ directories to PNG images\n```\n\n### Content Quality Assurance\n- **Code Block Refactoring**: Break down large code blocks (>20 lines) into educational segments\n- **Narrative Coherence**: Ensure smooth transitions and engaging learning flow\n- **Assessment Consistency**: Standardize multiple choice test formats across all modules\n- **Emoji Consistency**: Maintain standard emojis for learning paths and section headings\n\n## Special Considerations\n\n### Educational Focus\nThis repository prioritizes **pedagogical value over software engineering conventions**:\n- Code examples emphasize learning over optimization\n- Multiple implementations show different approaches\n- Documentation includes extensive explanations and context\n- Assessment materials require consistent formatting for student experience\n\n### Multi-Framework Coverage\nThe course covers **multiple AI frameworks simultaneously**:\n- Each framework has dedicated sessions with complete implementations\n- Code examples are self-contained within session directories\n- Dependencies are managed per-session to avoid conflicts\n- Production deployment patterns vary by framework\n\n### Cloud Integration\nDesigned for **cloud development environments**:\n- No local dependency management required for primary use case\n- GPU-accelerated workspaces for AI model training and inference\n- Pre-configured development tools and AI assistants\n- Seamless LLM API integration through cloud providers\n\nThis repository serves as both an educational resource and a practical implementation guide for modern AI agent development, emphasizing hands-on learning and production-ready patterns."

Usage notes:
- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, suggest improvements to it.
- When you make the initial CLAUDE.md, do not repeat yourself and do not include obvious instructions like "Provide helpful error messages to users", "Write unit tests for all new utilities", "Never include sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in code or commits" 
- Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered
- Don't include generic development practices
- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include the important parts.
- If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts. 
- Do not make up information such as "Common Development Tasks", "Tips for Development", "Support and Documentation" unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.
- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:

```
