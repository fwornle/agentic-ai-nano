**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd && git remote -v 2>/dev/null || echo \"No git remote found\"",
  "description": "Get current directory and git remote info"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md | head -3",
  "description": "Get most recent cross-project session files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-24_1200-1300_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`

   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1800-1900_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md | head -3",

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md 2>/dev/null | tail -5 || echo \"No cross-project sessions found\"",
  "description": "Check coding project sessions for nano-degree"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1900-2000_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la .specstory/history/ 2>/dev/null | head -10 || echo \"No local session history found\"",
  "description": "Check local session history"

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2100-2200_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2200-2300_g9b30a.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md | head -3",
  "description": "Get most recent cross-project session files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-24_1200-1300_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`

   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1800-1900_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md | head -3",

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md 2>/dev/null | tail -5 || echo \"No cross-project sessions found\"",
  "description": "Check coding project sessions for nano-degree"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1900-2000_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la .specstory/history/ 2>/dev/null | head -10 || echo \"No local session history found\"",
  "description": "Check local session history"

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2100-2200_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2200-2300_g9b30a.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md | head -3",
  "description": "Get most recent cross-project session files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-24_1200-1300_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`

   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1800-1900_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md | head -3",

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md 2>/dev/null | tail -5 || echo \"No cross-project sessions found\"",
  "description": "Check coding project sessions for nano-degree"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1900-2000_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la .specstory/history/ 2>/dev/null | head -10 || echo \"No local session history found\"",
  "description": "Check local session history"

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2100-2200_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2200-2300_g9b30a.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md | head -3",
  "description": "Get most recent cross-project session files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-24_1200-1300_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`

   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1800-1900_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md | head -3",

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md 2>/dev/null | tail -5 || echo \"No cross-project sessions found\"",
  "description": "Check coding project sessions for nano-degree"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1900-2000_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la .specstory/history/ 2>/dev/null | head -10 || echo \"No local session history found\"",
  "description": "Check local session history"

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2100-2200_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2200-2300_g9b30a.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md | head -3",
  "description": "Get most recent cross-project session files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-24_1200-1300_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`

   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1800-1900_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md | head -3",

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md 2>/dev/null | tail -5 || echo \"No cross-project sessions found\"",
  "description": "Check coding project sessions for nano-degree"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1900-2000_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la .specstory/history/ 2>/dev/null | head -10 || echo \"No local session history found\"",
  "description": "Check local session history"

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2100-2200_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2200-2300_g9b30a.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md | head -3",
  "description": "Get most recent cross-project session files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-24_1200-1300_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`

   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1800-1900_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md | head -3",

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md 2>/dev/null | tail -5 || echo \"No cross-project sessions found\"",
  "description": "Check coding project sessions for nano-degree"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1900-2000_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la .specstory/history/ 2>/dev/null | head -10 || echo \"No local session history found\"",
  "description": "Check local session history"

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2100-2200_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2200-2300_g9b30a.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md | head -3",
  "description": "Get most recent cross-project session files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-24_1200-1300_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`

   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1800-1900_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md | head -3",

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md 2>/dev/null | tail -5 || echo \"No cross-project sessions found\"",
  "description": "Check coding project sessions for nano-degree"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1900-2000_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la .specstory/history/ 2>/dev/null | head -10 || echo \"No local session history found\"",
  "description": "Check local session history"

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2100-2200_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2200-2300_g9b30a.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md | head -3",
  "description": "Get most recent cross-project session files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-24_1200-1300_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`

   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1800-1900_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md | head -3",

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md 2>/dev/null | tail -5 || echo \"No cross-project sessions found\"",
  "description": "Check coding project sessions for nano-degree"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1900-2000_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la .specstory/history/ 2>/dev/null | head -10 || echo \"No local session history found\"",
  "description": "Check local session history"

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2100-2200_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2200-2300_g9b30a.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md | head -3",
  "description": "Get most recent cross-project session files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-24_1200-1300_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`

   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1800-1900_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md | head -3",

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md 2>/dev/null | tail -5 || echo \"No cross-project sessions found\"",
  "description": "Check coding project sessions for nano-degree"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_1900-2000_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"

5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la .specstory/history/ 2>/dev/null | head -10 || echo \"No local session history found\"",
  "description": "Check local session history"

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-25_2100-2200_g9b30a_from-nano-degree.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

- Coding sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd && git remote -v 2>/dev/null || echo \"No git remote found\"",
  "description": "Get current directory and git remote info"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
