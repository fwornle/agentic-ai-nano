## Key Activities

### 15:30:09 - Exchange 1

**Assistant:** I need to see how it identifies the LSL files to process:

---

### 15:46:14 - Exchange 2

**Assistant:** Perfect! The LSL files are being created correctly:

- **Nano-degree**: `2025-09-05_1530-1630-session.md` (1943 bytes)
- **Coding**: `2025-09-05_1530-1630_coding-session-from-nano-degree.md` (1392 bytes) âœ…

### 15:46:58 - Exchange 3

**Assistant:** Perfect! Now I can see:

âœ… **Redirect indicator is working**: `ðŸ”€â†’coding` is now showing in the status line!

The remaining issues are:
1. **TBD issue**: Status shows `1546_TBD` instead of proper time boundary  
2. **30-minute boundary**: It should show `1530-1630` not `1546_TBD`

---

### 15:52:49 - Exchange 4

**Assistant:** Good coverage! I notice there are gaps in the afternoon:
- Missing: `1430-1530` and `1630-1730`, `1730-1830`

This makes sense - there probably wasn't significant coding activity during those time periods. The system captured coding content from 06:30 through 14:30, then again from 15:30 onwards, plus evening sessions.
