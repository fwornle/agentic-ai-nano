## Key Activities

### TodoWrite - 2025-09-10 11:22:49 UTC [13:22:49 CEST]

**User Request:** looks like light mode still doesn't fully display everything on the podcast UI. Dark: [Image #1], light: [Image #2]. Also, the volume controls don't do anything. Neither does the speed adjustment. And when closing the podcast window, it should remove all highlighting. Also, you weirdly don't select entire chapter sections, but sometimes start with the last two sentences of the previous chapter. Can this be done more naturally, so that jumping ahead/back feels more useful? And are the settings already stored in the current session of the browser?

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Fix light mode visibility - controls not fully visible",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "activeForm": "Fixing light mode control visibility"
    },
    {
      "content": "Implement working volume controls",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Implementing volume control functionality"
    },
    {
      "content": "Implement working speed adjustment",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Implementing speed adjustment functionality"
    },
    {
      "content": "Remove highlighting when closing podcast window",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Removing highlights on podcast close"
    },
    {
      "content": "Fix chapter selection to start at chapter beginnings",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Fixing chapter boundary selection"
    },
    {
      "content": "Implement browser session storage for settings",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Implementing session storage for settings"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
