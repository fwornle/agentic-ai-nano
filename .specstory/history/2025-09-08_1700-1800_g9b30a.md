## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-08 15:02:48 UTC [17:02:48 CEST]

**User Message:** nobody asked you to produce plantuml diagrams. The task was to find the screenshots, see if they already have a caption and, if not add one... but for this you'd need to understand what's in the image. Try to produce a caption for every screenshot that doesn't have one, then compare this to the context in which the image has been placed in the nano-degree and then tell me which images need to be worked on (as they are out of place)

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
