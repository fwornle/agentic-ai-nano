     2→
     3→Imagine if you could build data processing pipelines the way you architect distributed systems - taking small, focused components that handle specific data transformations and orchestrating them seamlessly to create anything from simple ETL workflows to complex multi-stage analytics engines. That's exactly what Atomic Agents delivers for data engineering: a microservices-inspired architecture where each component handles one data operation brilliantly and connects seamlessly with others.

    33→## Module Architecture
    34→
    35→Atomic Agents provides a component-based architecture for building modular data processing systems that scale like distributed stream processors but compose like building blocks. Built on Instructor and Pydantic foundations, the framework enables rapid data pipeline assembly through schema alignment and lightweight processing components.
    36→
    37→### Core Learning Concepts
    38→
    39→What You'll Master Across All Paths:
    40→
    41→- Component-based agent design for modular data pipeline composition patterns  
    42→- Atomic architecture principles for distributed data processing system scalability  
    43→- Schema matching and component alignment for seamless data transformation chaining  
    44→- Production deployment strategies for atomic agent data processing systems  
    45→
    46→**Code Files**: [`src/session6/`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/tree/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session6)
    47→**Quick Start**: `cd src/session6 && python example_usage.py`
    48→
    49→## Why Atomic Architecture?
    50→
    51→While other agent frameworks create monolithic processors that try to handle all data operations, Atomic Agents breaks intelligence into its smallest useful data processing units. Need stream transformation? Grab a transformation agent. Need data validation? Add a validation agent. Need them to work in sequence? They automatically align through schema contracts - no glue code, no integration complexity.
    52→
    53→In the world of petabyte-scale data processing, this modular approach mirrors the architectural patterns data engineers know from distributed streaming platforms like Kafka, Apache Beam, and distributed computing frameworks. Each atomic agent operates like a microservice in your data mesh, with single responsibility for data operations and minimal dependencies.

## Summary

I've successfully implemented all the recommended fixes for the screenshots:

### ✅ **Completed Fixes:**

1. **Fixed agno-agent.png caption mismatch**
   - **Before**: "This diagram reveals Agno's secret weapon for data workloads: every component is designed assuming data volume spikes and partition failures."
   - **After**: "Agno agent architecture interface showing model selection (OpenAI highlighted), memory system with chat history, knowledge base with document access, and tools including payments, web search, API calls, and SQL queries"

2. **Added atomic-agents.png to Session 6 with proper caption**
   - **Added**: The Atomic Agents logo to Session6_Atomic_Agents_Modular_Architecture.md
   - **Caption**: "Atomic Agents framework logo featuring an atomic symbol with robotic hand, emphasizing modular and composable AI agent architecture"

3. **Added caption to pydantic-ai.png**
   - **Added**: "PydanticAI framework logo with distinctive purple geometric symbol and black text branding"

4. **Added caption to crewai-overview.png**
   - **Added**: "CrewAI framework architecture showing agents with LLMs working collaboratively on tasks, with shared memory and tools leading to final outcomes"

All screenshots are now properly placed with accurate, descriptive captions that match their actual visual content rather than generic or mismatched descriptions. The captions help readers understand exactly what they're looking at and how it relates to the framework being discussed.
