## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

I'll read the recent session logs to establish continuity and understand what work has been happening in this project.

Now let me read the most recent session logs to understand the continuity:

Let me also check for more substantial session logs from earlier:

## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

## Session Continuity Summary

Based on reviewing the session logs, here's what I've found:

### Recent Work (Sep 2-3, 2025)
The last substantial session focused on **fixing the complex live logging system** with real-time semantic analysis capabilities. Key points:

1. **Hybrid Logging Architecture** - Working on two systems:
   - **Post-session logging**: Traditional capture (working ✅)
   - **Complex live logging**: Real-time semantic analysis with Groq integration (blocked ❌)

2. **File Interference Issue in `.mcp-sync/`**:
   - Files in `.mcp-sync/` directory are being continuously modified by IDE/background processes
   - This prevents the `tool-interaction-hook.js` from loading properly
   - Module exports return empty objects despite correct file content

3. **Current State**:
   - Simple real-time logger was introduced as a fallback
   - User emphasized we should **FIX the complex system**, not fall back to simple alternatives
   - The goal is sub-millisecond semantic analysis via Groq integration
   - Architecture diagrams were updated showing both working and blocked components

4. **Uncommitted Files**:
   - New logging scripts: `hybrid-session-logger.js`, `live-logging-coordinator.js`, `semantic-tool-interpreter.js`
   - Tool interaction hook in `.mcp-sync/`
   - Modified MCP configuration files

The session was working to debug why Node.js `require()` returns empty objects for files in `.mcp-sync/`, testing various approaches but not yet finding the root cause. The user wants the complex semantic analysis system fixed rather than accepting simpler alternatives.

**User Request:** the LSL files you just created are still not right - they are missing the user prompt and the tools results are abreviated (...) - revise the code again and repeat the entire process (delete LSL, re-create, delete transcript (but the first one), recreate --> example: # WORK SESSION (0630-0730)

**Generated:** 09/05/2025, 14:22:40
**Work Period:** 0630-0730
