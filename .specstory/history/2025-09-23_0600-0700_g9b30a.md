### TodoWrite - 2025-09-23 04:34:58 UTC [06:34:58 CEST]

**User Request:** update the course structure analysis (py, puml, png), indicating in the puml/png where we have corporate content. Check ALL links from any md, if they have targets (nav, images, references). If not, include them in the image_analysis_report.json (you have analyze_image_references.py - might need updated though). consolidate all screenshot/image_analysis... documents. There shall be one quality report (md) which allows me to easily jump to wherever a link/image/... is not yet fully working / OK. Remove all outdated test/analysis scripts and reports/jsons (in this context)

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
