### TodoWrite - 2025-09-05 11:12:31 UTC [13:12:31 CEST]

**User Request:** Fix the LSL in project coding (similar to what you just did in nano-degree -- Info must come from transcripts and include the full information... with time-zone adjusted timestamps (just take a look at how this is done by the live session logging system in coding - using the ingest mcp server on ~/Agentic/coding to understand the coding codebase). Once you have fixed it here - re-check the LSL in nano-degree and fix them there too. Also, once you have fixed all LSL in a project, recreate the traj. files to fully reflect what's been done to the codebase as per corresponding LSL

**User Request:** don't produce an incremental documentation - nobody cares what you improved by doing what. Just describe the existing system. Also, remove the broken png/puml (the one you just replaced by *-simple). Also remove the simple in this filename (and correct the references in the corresponding md's)

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json

  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/docs/live-session-logging-system.md",
  "old_string": "#### 1. \"No Context\" Entries Being Created\n\n**Symptoms**: Empty LSL files with \"No context\" entries that provide no information value\n\n**Root Cause**: Previous versions created entries even when no meaningful context was available\n\n**v3.0 Solutions**:\n```bash\n# Check content validation in transcript processing\nDEBUG_STATUS=1 node scripts/combined-status-line.js\n\n# Verify proper context extraction from transcript  \ngrep -r \"No context\" .specstory/history/ | head -5\n\n# Ensure latest routing logic is active\nnode -e \"console.log('Testing content validation...')\"\n```\n\n#### 2.
