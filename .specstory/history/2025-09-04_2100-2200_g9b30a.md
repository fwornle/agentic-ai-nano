### TodoWrite - 2025-09-04 19:01:05 UTC [21:01:05 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all technical details and user requests:

1. **Initial Problem Identification**: The user noticed that the current prompt about moving trajectory files should have created a new LSL/trajectory pair (1844-1944 timeframe) but didn't, and the status line showed the 1830-1930 session had ended.

2. **My Initial Misunderstanding**: I initially thought we were in the coding directory but Claude was logging to nano-degree. The user corrected me, explaining that they started the session by typing "coding" inside the nano-degree repo, so logging to nano-degree was correct.

3. **Core Issue Identification by User**: The user explained the sophisticated per-prompt routing system should detect when coding-related artifacts are being manipulated and route those specific prompts to the coding project while keeping others in nano-degree. This was the key insight I missed.

4. **User's Explicit Correction**: When I tried to duplicate code, the user said "the fix is wrong" and explained I should use the coding/bin/coding wrapper to enable automatic transcript monitoring for any project, and that copying was duplication that should be reverted.

5. **Technical Investigation**: I used the MCP git ingest tool to understand the coding project architecture and found the sophisticated routing logic in transcript-monitor.js.

6. **Root Cause Analysis**: The shouldRouteToCodingRepo method was too restrictive - only catching file modifications (Edit/Write/MultiEdit) but missing Bash commands, Read operations, Grep searches, and concept discussions about coding tools.

7. **Solution Implementation**: I enhanced the routing logic to detect:
   - File reads from coding repo
   - Bash commands affecting coding files
   - Grep/search operations in coding
   - MCP tools related to coding infrastructure
   - User messages containing coding-specific concepts
   - Architecture discussions about coding tools

8. **Testing and Validation**: The updated routing logic now correctly identifies coding-related prompts that should be routed to the coding project.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user identified that their Live Session Logging (LSL) system has sophisticated per-prompt content routing that should detect when coding-related artifacts are being manipulated and route those specific prompts to the coding project for logging, while keeping non-coding prompts in the current project (nano-degree). The user wanted me to understand why recent coding-related prompts (moving trajectory files, copying transcript-monitor.js, discussing LSL architecture) weren't being routed to the coding project, and fix the routing logic. They also wanted me to understand that everything should be manageable from the coding/bin/coding wrapper script without duplicating code.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches
   - Per-prompt intelligent content routing between projects
   - Transcript monitoring and parsing from Claude Code .jsonl files
   - Session boundary logic (e.g., 1630-1730, 1730-1830, 1930-2030)
   - Cross-repository content routing between nano-degree and coding repositories
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
   - Semantic analysis and constraint monitoring
   - Knowledge base systems (UKB, VKB)
   - JavaScript/Node.js automation scripts
   - Claude Code transcript structure with user/assistant message pairs

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/transcript-monitor.js`
     - Core transcript monitoring script with routing logic
     - Enhanced shouldRouteToCodingRepo method (lines 430-530) from restrictive file-modification-only logic to comprehensive detection
     - Original code only caught Edit/Write/MultiEdit operations
     - Updated to detect: Read operations, Bash commands, Grep searches, MCP tools, coding concepts in user messages
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/launch-claude.sh`
     - Added automatic transcript monitoring startup functionality
     - Enhanced with start_transcript_monitoring function to auto-start monitoring for any project
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/test-content-routing.js`
     - Test script for validating content routing logic
     - Confirmed updated routing works correctly for coding-related prompts
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/scripts/fix-user-prompts-in-lsl.js`
     - Fixed "No context" entries in LSL files by extracting actual user messages from transcript
     - Successfully fixed 99 entries across multiple LSL files

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong approach error**: I initially tried to duplicate code from coding to nano-degree
     - **User feedback**: "the fix is wrong - you should be able to run everything from within project coding"
     - **Fix**: Reverted duplication and enhanced the coding/bin/coding wrapper instead
   - **Misunderstanding project context**: I thought we were in wrong session
     - **User feedback**: "wrong. This session here got started by typing 'coding' inside the nano-degree repo file tree"
     - **Fix**: Understood that logging to nano-degree was correct, but routing logic was broken
   - **Overly restrictive routing logic**: shouldRouteToCodingRepo only caught file modifications
     - **Fix**: Enhanced to detect reads, bash commands, grep operations, MCP tools, and concept discussions

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully solved the core content routing issue by understanding that the system needs per-prompt intelligence to route coding-related activities to the coding project while keeping project-specific work local. Enhanced the transcript monitor's routing logic to be more comprehensive. Also solved the "No context" issue in LSL files by implementing proper user message extraction from transcripts.

6. All user messages:
   - "move all trajectory files to a new sub-folder trajectory (in .specstory)"
   - "this last prompt should have been create in a new pair of LSL/traj files (1844-1944 maybe, seen that it was 1844 when we ran the prompt). However, there is no such file and the statusLine shows: 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴1830-1930-session(ended)"
   - "but this didn't fix the issue, as the issue was that the automatic mechanism for creation of new LSL/traj. pairs is not working outside coding. In addition, your recreation abreviated the prompt: **User Request:** this last prompt should have been create in a new pair of LSL/traj files (1844-1944 maybe, seen that it was 1844 when we ran the prompt). However, the... --> fix this issue: The issue is that there's no automatic transcript monitoring running for nano-degree that creates new LSL files."
   - "the fix is wrong - you should be able to run everything from within project coding... we are starting the coding session using coding/bin/coding --> this wrapper is in coding. Should be possible to start the transcript monitoring for nano-degree via this script. Revert your copying (= duplication) of code files and devise a fix to coding/bin/coding to enable the automatic starting of the transcript monitoring in any project (i. e. even outside coding). Also note that the last prompt and this very prompt were both coding related (you copied from coding and we are about to change file coding/bin/coding --> in coding) and, as such, should have been logged in the coding LSL. Furthermore, since it is now after 20:30, a new set of LSL/traj. files would have (had) to be created in coding/.specstory/history). Also, the initial prompts which you just copied to a new LSL file 1930-2030 happened at 20:35 (ish) --> after 20:30. This also didn't work and you need to manually rectify this now"
   - "Looking at the User Requests - I see a lot of No Context entries - we just fixed this in project coding - check the last two LSL in coding to see how we fixed it and potentially use the script which we created there for retroactive fixing. If you cannot fix it with this script, just recreate from the transcripts"
   - "wrong. This session here got started by typing 'coding' inside the nano-degree repo file tree... so, everything is normal (incl. logging into the nano-degree transcripts. However, there must be a per-prompt logic which checks if any coding-related artifacts are manipulated... and copying files from coding or manipulating files in coding are both such operations and, as such, should have been detected as coding relevant... which implies that the logging of these two prompts happens in coding (rest in nano-degree). The other issue is that, if we are outside (= after) a currently open live logging window (60 mins atm.) then a new pair of LSL-/traj.-files needs created... in whichever project has been chosen for logging (here: nano-degree for all non-coding artifact touching prompts and coding for the ones that do touch coding artifacts). Check the code in coding why it didn't do it like this. If you need to understand coding, use the ingest mcp server to read from ~/Agentic/coding"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Create retroactive LSL files for the missed coding prompts that should have been routed to the coding project
   - Test the updated routing system with real-world usage to ensure it correctly identifies coding vs. project activities

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed enhancing the content routing logic in `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/transcript-monitor.js` by expanding the `shouldRouteToCodingRepo` method to detect not just file modifications but also:
   - File reads from coding repository
   - Bash commands affecting coding files (cp, mv, rm, ls, find, mkdir)
   - Grep/search operations in coding directories
   - MCP tools related to coding infrastructure
   - User messages containing coding-specific concepts (transcript-monitor, LSL, semantic analysis, etc.)
   - Architecture discussions about coding tools
   
   The testing confirmed the updated routing logic works correctly, and I was in the process of updating my todo list to mark the routing fix as completed and move to creating retroactive LSL files for the missed coding prompts.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's explicit request: "Check the code in coding why it didn't do it like this" and the current todo item "Create retroactive LSL files for the missed coding prompts", the next step would be to manually create the missing LSL/trajectory file pairs in the coding project for the prompts that should have been routed there (the trajectory file organization discussion and the transcript monitoring fixes), ensuring they get logged in the appropriate time boundaries (2030-2130 for the recent work since it occurred after 20:30 CEST)..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

   - **Wrong approach error**: I initially tried to duplicate code from coding to nano-degree
     - **User feedback**: "the fix is wrong - you should be able to run everything from within project coding"
     - **Fix**: Reverted duplication and enhanced the coding/bin/coding wrapper instead
   - **Misunderstanding project context**: I thought we were in wrong session
     - **User feedback**: "wrong. This session here got started by typing 'coding' inside the nano-degree repo file tree"
     - **Fix**: Understood that logging to nano-degree was correct, but routing logic was broken
   - **Overly restrictive routing logic**: shouldRouteToCodingRepo only caught file modifications
     - **Fix**: Enhanced to detect reads, bash commands, grep operations, MCP tools, and concept discussions

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully solved the core content routing issue by understanding that the system needs per-prompt intelligence to route coding-related activities to the coding project while keeping project-specific work local. Enhanced the transcript monitor's routing logic to be more comprehensive. Also solved the "No context" issue in LSL files by implementing proper user message extraction from transcripts.

6. All user messages:
   - "move all trajectory files to a new sub-folder trajectory (in .specstory)"
   - "this last prompt should have been create in a new pair of LSL/traj files (1844-1944 maybe, seen that it was 1844 when we ran the prompt). However, there is no such file and the statusLine shows: 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴1830-1930-session(ended)"
   - "but this didn't fix the issue, as the issue was that the automatic mechanism for creation of new LSL/traj. pairs is not working outside coding.

   - "the fix is wrong - you should be able to run everything from within project coding... we are starting the coding session using coding/bin/coding --> this wrapper is in coding. Should be possible to start the transcript monitoring for nano-degree via this script. Revert your copying (= duplication) of code files and devise a fix to coding/bin/coding to enable the automatic starting of the transcript monitoring in any project (i. e. even outside coding). Also note that the last prompt and this very prompt were both coding related (you copied from coding and we are about to change file coding/bin/coding --> in coding) and, as such, should have been logged in the coding LSL. Furthermore, since it is now after 20:30, a new set of LSL/traj. files would have (had) to be created in coding/.specstory/history). Also, the initial prompts which you just copied to a new LSL file 1930-2030 happened at 20:35 (ish) --> after 20:30. This also didn't work and you need to manually rectify this now"
   - "Looking at the User Requests - I see a lot of No Context entries - we just fixed this in project coding - check the last two LSL in coding to see how we fixed it and potentially use the script which we created there for retroactive fixing.

Check the code in coding why it didn't do it like this. If you need to understand coding, use the ingest mcp server to read from ~/Agentic/coding"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Create retroactive LSL files for the missed coding prompts that should have been routed to the coding project
   - Test the updated routing system with real-world usage to ensure it correctly identifies coding vs. project activities

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed enhancing the content routing logic in `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/transcript-monitor.js` by expanding the `shouldRouteToCodingRepo` method to detect not just file modifications but also:
   - File reads from coding repository
   - Bash commands affecting coding files (cp, mv, rm, ls, find, mkdir)
   - Grep/search operations in coding directories
   - MCP tools related to coding infrastructure
   - User messages containing coding-specific concepts (transcript-monitor, LSL, semantic analysis, etc.)
   - Architecture discussions about coding tools
   
   The testing confirmed the updated routing logic works correctly, and I was in the process of updating my todo list to mark the routing fix as completed and move to creating retroactive LSL files for the missed coding prompts.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's explicit request: "Check the code in coding why it didn't do it like this" and the current todo item "Create retroactive LSL files for the missed coding prompts", the next step would be to manually create the missing LSL/trajectory file pairs in the coding project for the prompts that should have been routed there (the trajectory file organization discussion and the transcript monitoring fixes), ensuring they get logged in the appropriate time boundaries (2030-2130 for the recent work since it occurred after 20:30 CEST)..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Bash - 2025-09-04 19:01:05 UTC [21:01:05 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all technical details and user requests:

1. **Initial Problem Identification**: The user noticed that the current prompt about moving trajectory files should have created a new LSL/trajectory pair (1844-1944 timeframe) but didn't, and the status line showed the 1830-1930 session had ended.

2. **My Initial Misunderstanding**: I initially thought we were in the coding directory but Claude was logging to nano-degree. The user corrected me, explaining that they started the session by typing "coding" inside the nano-degree repo, so logging to nano-degree was correct.

3. **Core Issue Identification by User**: The user explained the sophisticated per-prompt routing system should detect when coding-related artifacts are being manipulated and route those specific prompts to the coding project while keeping others in nano-degree. This was the key insight I missed.

4. **User's Explicit Correction**: When I tried to duplicate code, the user said "the fix is wrong" and explained I should use the coding/bin/coding wrapper to enable automatic transcript monitoring for any project, and that copying was duplication that should be reverted.

5. **Technical Investigation**: I used the MCP git ingest tool to understand the coding project architecture and found the sophisticated routing logic in transcript-monitor.js.

6. **Root Cause Analysis**: The shouldRouteToCodingRepo method was too restrictive - only catching file modifications (Edit/Write/MultiEdit) but missing Bash commands, Read operations, Grep searches, and concept discussions about coding tools.

7. **Solution Implementation**: I enhanced the routing logic to detect:
   - File reads from coding repo
   - Bash commands affecting coding files
   - Grep/search operations in coding
   - MCP tools related to coding infrastructure
   - User messages containing coding-specific concepts
   - Architecture discussions about coding tools

8. **Testing and Validation**: The updated routing logic now correctly identifies coding-related prompts that should be routed to the coding project.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user identified that their Live Session Logging (LSL) system has sophisticated per-prompt content routing that should detect when coding-related artifacts are being manipulated and route those specific prompts to the coding project for logging, while keeping non-coding prompts in the current project (nano-degree). The user wanted me to understand why recent coding-related prompts (moving trajectory files, copying transcript-monitor.js, discussing LSL architecture) weren't being routed to the coding project, and fix the routing logic. They also wanted me to understand that everything should be manageable from the coding/bin/coding wrapper script without duplicating code.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches
   - Per-prompt intelligent content routing between projects
   - Transcript monitoring and parsing from Claude Code .jsonl files
   - Session boundary logic (e.g., 1630-1730, 1730-1830, 1930-2030)
   - Cross-repository content routing between nano-degree and coding repositories
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
   - Semantic analysis and constraint monitoring
   - Knowledge base systems (UKB, VKB)
   - JavaScript/Node.js automation scripts
   - Claude Code transcript structure with user/assistant message pairs

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/transcript-monitor.js`
     - Core transcript monitoring script with routing logic
     - Enhanced shouldRouteToCodingRepo method (lines 430-530) from restrictive file-modification-only logic to comprehensive detection
     - Original code only caught Edit/Write/MultiEdit operations
     - Updated to detect: Read operations, Bash commands, Grep searches, MCP tools, coding concepts in user messages
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/launch-claude.sh`
     - Added automatic transcript monitoring startup functionality
     - Enhanced with start_transcript_monitoring function to auto-start monitoring for any project
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/test-content-routing.js`
     - Test script for validating content routing logic
     - Confirmed updated routing works correctly for coding-related prompts
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/scripts/fix-user-prompts-in-lsl.js`
     - Fixed "No context" entries in LSL files by extracting actual user messages from transcript
     - Successfully fixed 99 entries across multiple LSL files

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong approach error**: I initially tried to duplicate code from coding to nano-degree
     - **User feedback**: "the fix is wrong - you should be able to run everything from within project coding"

### Edit - 2025-09-04 19:01:05 UTC [21:01:05 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all technical details and user requests:

1. **Initial Problem Identification**: The user noticed that the current prompt about moving trajectory files should have created a new LSL/trajectory pair (1844-1944 timeframe) but didn't, and the status line showed the 1830-1930 session had ended.

2. **My Initial Misunderstanding**: I initially thought we were in the coding directory but Claude was logging to nano-degree. The user corrected me, explaining that they started the session by typing "coding" inside the nano-degree repo, so logging to nano-degree was correct.

3. **Core Issue Identification by User**: The user explained the sophisticated per-prompt routing system should detect when coding-related artifacts are being manipulated and route those specific prompts to the coding project while keeping others in nano-degree. This was the key insight I missed.

4. **User's Explicit Correction**: When I tried to duplicate code, the user said "the fix is wrong" and explained I should use the coding/bin/coding wrapper to enable automatic transcript monitoring for any project, and that copying was duplication that should be reverted.

5. **Technical Investigation**: I used the MCP git ingest tool to understand the coding project architecture and found the sophisticated routing logic in transcript-monitor.js.

6. **Root Cause Analysis**: The shouldRouteToCodingRepo method was too restrictive - only catching file modifications (Edit/Write/MultiEdit) but missing Bash commands, Read operations, Grep searches, and concept discussions about coding tools.

7. **Solution Implementation**: I enhanced the routing logic to detect:
   - File reads from coding repo
   - Bash commands affecting coding files
   - Grep/search operations in coding
   - MCP tools related to coding infrastructure
   - User messages containing coding-specific concepts
   - Architecture discussions about coding tools

8. **Testing and Validation**: The updated routing logic now correctly identifies coding-related prompts that should be routed to the coding project.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user identified that their Live Session Logging (LSL) system has sophisticated per-prompt content routing that should detect when coding-related artifacts are being manipulated and route those specific prompts to the coding project for logging, while keeping non-coding prompts in the current project (nano-degree). The user wanted me to understand why recent coding-related prompts (moving trajectory files, copying transcript-monitor.js, discussing LSL architecture) weren't being routed to the coding project, and fix the routing logic. They also wanted me to understand that everything should be manageable from the coding/bin/coding wrapper script without duplicating code.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches
   - Per-prompt intelligent content routing between projects
   - Transcript monitoring and parsing from Claude Code .jsonl files
   - Session boundary logic (e.g., 1630-1730, 1730-1830, 1930-2030)
   - Cross-repository content routing between nano-degree and coding repositories
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
   - Semantic analysis and constraint monitoring
   - Knowledge base systems (UKB, VKB)
   - JavaScript/Node.js automation scripts
   - Claude Code transcript structure with user/assistant message pairs

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all technical details and user requests:

1. **Initial Problem Identification**: The user noticed that the current prompt about moving trajectory files should have created a new LSL/trajectory pair (1844-1944 timeframe) but didn't, and the status line showed the 1830-1930 session had ended.

2. **My Initial Misunderstanding**: I initially thought we were in the coding directory but Claude was logging to nano-degree. The user corrected me, explaining that they started the session by typing "coding" inside the nano-degree repo, so logging to nano-degree was correct.

3. **Core Issue Identification by User**: The user explained the sophisticated per-prompt routing system should detect when coding-related artifacts are being manipulated and route those specific prompts to the coding project while keeping others in nano-degree. This was the key insight I missed.

4. **User's Explicit Correction**: When I tried to duplicate code, the user said "the fix is wrong" and explained I should use the coding/bin/coding wrapper to enable automatic transcript monitoring for any project, and that copying was duplication that should be reverted.

5. **Technical Investigation**: I used the MCP git ingest tool to understand the coding project architecture and found the sophisticated routing logic in transcript-monitor.js.

6. **Root Cause Analysis**: The shouldRouteToCodingRepo method was too restrictive - only catching file modifications (Edit/Write/MultiEdit) but missing Bash commands, Read operations, Grep searches, and concept discussions about coding tools.

7. **Solution Implementation**: I enhanced the routing logic to detect:
   - File reads from coding repo
   - Bash commands affecting coding files
   - Grep/search operations in coding
   - MCP tools related to coding infrastructure
   - User messages containing coding-specific concepts
   - Architecture discussions about coding tools

8. **Testing and Validation**: The updated routing logic now correctly identifies coding-related prompts that should be routed to the coding project.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user identified that their Live Session Logging (LSL) system has sophisticated per-prompt content routing that should detect when coding-related artifacts are being manipulated and route those specific prompts to the coding project for logging, while keeping non-coding prompts in the current project (nano-degree). The user wanted me to understand why recent coding-related prompts (moving trajectory files, copying transcript-monitor.js, discussing LSL architecture) weren't being routed to the coding project, and fix the routing logic. They also wanted me to understand that everything should be manageable from the coding/bin/coding wrapper script without duplicating code.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches
   - Per-prompt intelligent content routing between projects
   - Transcript monitoring and parsing from Claude Code .jsonl files
   - Session boundary logic (e.g., 1630-1730, 1730-1830, 1930-2030)
   - Cross-repository content routing between nano-degree and coding repositories
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
   - Semantic analysis and constraint monitoring
   - Knowledge base systems (UKB, VKB)
   - JavaScript/Node.js automation scripts
   - Claude Code transcript structure with user/assistant message pairs

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/transcript-monitor.js`
     - Core transcript monitoring script with routing logic
     - Enhanced shouldRouteToCodingRepo method (lines 430-530) from restrictive file-modification-only logic to comprehensive detection
     - Original code only caught Edit/Write/MultiEdit operations
     - Updated to detect: Read operations, Bash commands, Grep searches, MCP tools, coding concepts in user messages
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/launch-claude.sh`
     - Added automatic transcript monitoring startup functionality
     - Enhanced with start_transcript_monitoring function to auto-start monitoring for any project
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/test-content-routing.js`
     - Test script for validating content routing logic
     - Confirmed updated routing works correctly for coding-related prompts
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/scripts/fix-user-prompts-in-lsl.js`
     - Fixed "No context" entries in LSL files by extracting actual user messages from transcript
     - Successfully fixed 99 entries across multiple LSL files

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong approach error**: I initially tried to duplicate code from coding to nano-degree
     - **User feedback**: "the fix is wrong - you should be able to run everything from within project coding"
     - **Fix**: Reverted duplication and enhanced the coding/bin/coding wrapper instead
   - **Misunderstanding project context**: I thought we were in wrong session
     - **User feedback**: "wrong. This session here got started by typing 'coding' inside the nano-degree repo file tree"
     - **Fix**: Understood that logging to nano-degree was correct, but routing logic was broken
   - **Overly restrictive routing logic**: shouldRouteToCodingRepo only caught file modifications
     - **Fix**: Enhanced to detect reads, bash commands, grep operations, MCP tools, and concept discussions

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully solved the core content routing issue by understanding that the system needs per-prompt intelligence to route coding-related activities to the coding project while keeping project-specific work local. Enhanced the transcript monitor's routing logic to be more comprehensive. Also solved the "No context" issue in LSL files by implementing proper user message extraction from transcripts.

6. All user messages:
   - "move all trajectory files to a new sub-folder trajectory (in .specstory)"
   - "this last prompt should have been create in a new pair of LSL/traj files (1844-1944 maybe, seen that it was 1844 when we ran the prompt). However, there is no such file and the statusLine shows: 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴1830-1930-session(ended)"
   - "but this didn't fix the issue, as the issue was that the automatic mechanism for creation of new LSL/traj. pairs is not working outside coding. In addition, your recreation abreviated the prompt: **User Request:** this last prompt should have been create in a new pair of LSL/traj files (1844-1944 maybe, seen that it was 1844 when we ran the prompt). However, the... --> fix this issue: The issue is that there's no automatic transcript monitoring running for nano-degree that creates new LSL files."
   - "the fix is wrong - you should be able to run everything from within project coding... we are starting the coding session using coding/bin/coding --> this wrapper is in coding. Should be possible to start the transcript monitoring for nano-degree via this script. Revert your copying (= duplication) of code files and devise a fix to coding/bin/coding to enable the automatic starting of the transcript monitoring in any project (i. e. even outside coding). Also note that the last prompt and this very prompt were both coding related (you copied from coding and we are about to change file coding/bin/coding --> in coding) and, as such, should have been logged in the coding LSL. Furthermore, since it is now after 20:30, a new set of LSL/traj. files would have (had) to be created in coding/.specstory/history). Also, the initial prompts which you just copied to a new LSL file 1930-2030 happened at 20:35 (ish) --> after 20:30. This also didn't work and you need to manually rectify this now"
   - "Looking at the User Requests - I see a lot of No Context entries - we just fixed this in project coding - check the last two LSL in coding to see how we fixed it and potentially use the script which we created there for retroactive fixing. If you cannot fix it with this script, just recreate from the transcripts"
   - "wrong. This session here got started by typing 'coding' inside the nano-degree repo file tree... so, everything is normal (incl. logging into the nano-degree transcripts. However, there must be a per-prompt logic which checks if any coding-related artifacts are manipulated... and copying files from coding or manipulating files in coding are both such operations and, as such, should have been detected as coding relevant... which implies that the logging of these two prompts happens in coding (rest in nano-degree). The other issue is that, if we are outside (= after) a currently open live logging window (60 mins atm.) then a new pair of LSL-/traj.-files needs created... in whichever project has been chosen for logging (here: nano-degree for all non-coding artifact touching prompts and coding for the ones that do touch coding artifacts). Check the code in coding why it didn't do it like this. If you need to understand coding, use the ingest mcp server to read from ~/Agentic/coding"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Create retroactive LSL files for the missed coding prompts that should have been routed to the coding project
   - Test the updated routing system with real-world usage to ensure it correctly identifies coding vs. project activities

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed enhancing the content routing logic in `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/transcript-monitor.js` by expanding the `shouldRouteToCodingRepo` method to detect not just file modifications but also:
   - File reads from coding repository
   - Bash commands affecting coding files (cp, mv, rm, ls, find, mkdir)
   - Grep/search operations in coding directories
   - MCP tools related to coding infrastructure
   - User messages containing coding-specific concepts (transcript-monitor, LSL, semantic analysis, etc.)
   - Architecture discussions about coding tools
   
   The testing confirmed the updated routing logic works correctly, and I was in the process of updating my todo list to mark the routing fix as completed and move to creating retroactive LSL files for the missed coding prompts.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's explicit request: "Check the code in coding why it didn't do it like this" and the current todo item "Create retroactive LSL files for the missed coding prompts", the next step would be to manually create the missing LSL/trajectory file pairs in the coding project for the prompts that should have been routed there (the trajectory file organization discussion and the transcript monitoring fixes), ensuring they get logged in the appropriate time boundaries (2030-2130 for the recent work since it occurred after 20:30 CEST)..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
