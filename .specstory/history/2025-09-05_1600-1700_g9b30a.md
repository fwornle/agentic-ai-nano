## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 14:00:47 UTC [16:00:47 CEST]

**User Message:** [Request interrupted by user for tool use]

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### TodoWrite - 2025-09-05 14:41:42 UTC [16:41:42 CEST]

**User Request:** then analyze what went wrong and fix - it seems (from the statusLine, 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋1630-1730-session) that the redirect logic is not working. Maybe, in case an initial "changed artifacts" based check does NOT demand a redirect, we need to extend it by a semantic analysis of the prompt to see if this is coding related (knowing from the trajectory, what coding is about)

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json

### Task - 2025-08-27 21:31:49 UTC [23:31:49 CEST]

**User Request:** in fact... I also reverted your changes from session 2 - this was also garbage (just a few words at the beginning and end of the file - not a proper narrative that takes the student throught the entire file. Start from 2 and do it for the entire module (up to session 9). Don't forget any optional SessionX_ModuleY files

**Tool:** Task
**Input:** ```json
{
  "subagent_type": "course-material-narrator",
  "description": "Properly narrate Session 2",
  "prompt": "Transform Session 2 at `docs-content/03_mcp-acp-a2a/Session2_FileSystem_MCP_Server.md` into an engaging learning experience with comprehensive narrative throughout the entire file.\n\nContext from the broader module:\n- Session 0: Introduced MCP, ACP, and A2A as the communication revolution\n- Session 1: Built first MCP server (weather) - learned basic protocol patterns\n- THIS SESSION 2: Building secure file system access - the most dangerous and important MCP capability\n- Session 3: Will integrate MCP servers with LangChain for agent orchestration\n- Sessions 4-5: Production deployment and advanced security\n- Sessions 6-9: Agent-to-agent communication protocols\n\nSession 2's critical role: This is where students learn that MCP isn't just about safe APIs like weather - it can handle the most dangerous operations (file system access) while maintaining security. This teaches the security mindset essential for all future sessions.\n\nRequirements:\n1. Add narrative throughout the ENTIRE file, not just at the beginning\n2. Explain the significance of each code block and security pattern\n3. Connect each implementation detail to the broader security architecture\n4. Show how this prepares students for production deployment in Sessions 4-5\n5. Maintain professional tone without childish enthusiasm\n6. Preserve ALL technical content, code examples, tests, and exercises exactly as they are\n7. Make security feel like engineering excellence, not fear-based restrictions\n\nCreate a comprehensive narrative that guides students through every section of the file."

**Result:** ❌ Error
