## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-05 14:00:47 UTC [16:00:47 CEST]

**User Message:** [Request interrupted by user for tool use]

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### TodoWrite - 2025-09-05 14:41:42 UTC [16:41:42 CEST]

**User Request:** then analyze what went wrong and fix - it seems (from the statusLine, 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋1630-1730-session) that the redirect logic is not working. Maybe, in case an initial "changed artifacts" based check does NOT demand a redirect, we need to extend it by a semantic analysis of the prompt to see if this is coding related (knowing from the trajectory, what coding is about)

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
