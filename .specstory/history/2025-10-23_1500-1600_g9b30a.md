Warmup

### Assistant

I'm Claude Code, ready to assist with file search and codebase navigation for the nano-degree project. I've reviewed the CLAUDE.md guidelines and understand the critical rules:

- No parallel versions (v2, v3, enhanced, etc.) - always fix originals
- Always verify results with actual command output before claiming success
- Use standard Edit/Write tools for code modifications, not Serena MCP
- Follow project-specific configurations and best practices

I'm currently in `/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree` which is a git repository on the main branch.

How can I help you with your nano-degree project? I can:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate and explore the codebase structure

What would you like to find or explore?
