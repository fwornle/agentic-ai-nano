## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-28 12:02:16 UTC [14:02:16 CEST]

**User Message:** now revisit ALL md-files in all modules for formatting issues - it seems that some of the added narration and previous formatting inconsistencies make the document structure very confusing (very long headings, consecutive headings at the same level, jumps in heading level (2-4), emphasis used instead of headings, etc.)... example: [Image #1]\
--> I want a clear consistent document structure that makes it easy to navigate around documents using the sidebar

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-28 12:04:50 UTC [14:04:50 CEST]

**User Message:** I need you to systematically fix document formatting issues across all Session*_Module*_*.md files in the course content. The main issues are:

1. **Very long business anecdote headings** like "## *How Amazon Revolutionized Global Logistics with $5.7B Savings Through Intelligent Agent Orchestration*" - these should be replaced with simple "## [Company] [Challenge/Topic]" headings
2. **Inconsistent module prerequisites** - all should use the standard format: "> **⚠️ ADVANCED OPTIONAL MODULE**  \n...

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-28 12:15:00 UTC [14:15:00 CEST]

**User Message:** I need you to fix the remaining bold/italic headings in these specific files:

1. /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/02_rag/Session8_MultiModal_Advanced_RAG.md
2. /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/02_rag/Session7_Agentic_RAG_Systems.md  
3. /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/02_rag/Session6_Graph_Based_RAG.md

These files contain headings like "## **Part 2: Advanced Multimodal RAG-Fusion...**" that should be converted to proper structural headings without ...

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-28 12:21:03 UTC [14:21:03 CEST]

**User Message:** Please analyze the heading hierarchy in all markdown files in the course content to identify any improper heading level jumps (like going from ## to #### without a ###). 

Focus on checking:
1. Session files (Session0_*.md through Session10_*.md)
2. Module files (Session*_Module*_*.md) 
3. Any other content markdown files

Look for patterns where heading levels skip improperly (H2 → H4, H1 → H3 when it should be H1 → H2, etc.) and report:
- Which files have heading hierarchy issues
- What the sp...

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-28 12:26:52 UTC [14:26:52 CEST]

**User Message:** I need you to find and fix image caption formatting issues across all markdown files in the course content. The problem is that image captions are incorrectly formatted as headings (using # symbols) which breaks sidebar navigation.

Please:

1. **Find all image references** in markdown files using patterns like:
   - `![alt text](image.png)` 
   - `![RAG Architecture](images/rag-overview.png)`
   - Any line that follows an image and appears to be a caption

2. **Identify incorrectly formatted ca...
