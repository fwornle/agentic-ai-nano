### Glob - 2025-08-30 02:44:08 UTC [04:44:08 CEST]

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- All sessions are logged locally in the current project's .specstory/history directory
- For multiple sessions, start with most recent and work backwards
- Focus on understanding the project context and previous work completed


**Tool:** Glob
**Input:** ```json
{
  "pattern": ".specstory/history/*session.md"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
