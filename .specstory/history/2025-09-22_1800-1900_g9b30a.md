## Key Activities

### TodoWrite - 2025-09-22 16:24:52 UTC [18:24:52 CEST]

**User Request:** The separation of corporate content and publicly available content is now working. Update the detailed README.md in nano-degree-corporate to explain how it works and how to maintain it. Also update the README.md in the main repo (nano-degree) to explain the system (without the deeper technical details - those are for the private repo nano-degree-corporate)... but it needs to be clear that sensitive content is not available outside the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> corporate network (neither in the published version, nor in the repo)

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Update corporate repository README with technical details",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "activeForm": "Updating corporate repository README with technical details"
    },
    {
      "content": "Update main repository README with public-facing documentation",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Updating main repository README with public-facing documentation"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** The separation of corporate content and publicly available content is now working. Update the detailed README.md in nano-degree-corporate to explain how it works and how to maintain it. Also update the README.md in the main repo (nano-degree) to explain the system (without the deeper technical details - those are for the private repo nano-degree-corporate)... but it needs to be clear that sensitive content is not available outside the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> corporate network (neither in the published version, nor in the repo)

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "git add README.md && git commit -m \"docs: comprehensive update with technical details and maintenance procedures\n\n- Added detailed content injection system documentation  \n- Included page configuration examples\n- Added comprehensive maintenance procedures\n- Updated repository structure with current file list\n- Added troubleshooting and development workflows\" && git push",
