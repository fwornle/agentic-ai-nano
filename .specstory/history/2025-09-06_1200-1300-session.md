**Assistant:** Perfect! All the issues have been resolved:

## ✅ Fixed and Cleaned Up

**1. LSL Files Fixed:**
- ❌ Removed all corrupted LSL files with "-1" references and timestamp inconsistencies (Aug 31 - Sep 2 period)  
- ✅ Regenerated clean LSL files with proper titles like `# WORK SESSION (2025-09-01_2330-0030)` instead of `# WORK SESSION (2025-09-01_-1)`
- ✅ Fixed timestamp consistency between filenames and content

**2. Trajectory Cleanup:**
- ❌ Removed entire `/trajectory/` directory with all outdated per-session trajectory files
- ✅ Only the new `comprehensive-project-trajectory.md` remains as the single unified trajectory

**3. Directory Structure Now Clean:**
```
.specstory/
├── comprehensive-project-trajectory.md  # NEW: Single trajectory file
├── history/                            # CLEANE...
