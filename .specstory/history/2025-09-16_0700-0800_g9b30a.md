**User Message:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

**User Message:** the /sl (n) command (~/.claude/commands) needs improved as follows: (1) determine what project (/repo) we are currently running from, (2) read the newest (n) local .specstory/history file(s), (2) read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files. If the timestamp of the coding files is newer or about the same as the ones from the local history, we were clearly (also) doing coding work last. If it is only coding, present the coding summary. If it is a mix, present a mix.
