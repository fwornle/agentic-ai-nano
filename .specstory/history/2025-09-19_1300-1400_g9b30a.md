### Text Exchange - 2025-09-19 11:38:20 UTC [13:38:20 CEST]

**User Message:** stop - don't look into the LSL files. Just the nano-degree transcript. Remember that the timestamps in transcripts are UTC --> 2h ahead of us. So, we created this just before 11 (say 10-11) --> should be around 8-9. Or earlier/later.

 Perfect! Now I have the correct style file. Let me create the corrected PlantUML files for the three BMW diagrams by
  replacing !theme plain with !include ../../config/_standard-style.puml:\
