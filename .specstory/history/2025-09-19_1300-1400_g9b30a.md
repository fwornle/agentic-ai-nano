it works from a visibility point of view and the diagrams are now showing as embedded images. However, when re-constructing the information in session 10 (you had accidentally deleted this yesterday), you included the wrong version... the one you reconstructed. Replace this version by the document found in nano-degree/tmp. Also copy the images found in this folder to the corporate only folder and include all of these documents in the encryption file. You will need to adjust the links of course to make it work as expected. In addition, you need to re-construct (/retrieve) the puml files which correspond to these three images. They can be found in the transcript around 7-9am UTC (9-11 CEST). Make sure you retrieve the correct versions - they must include our style sheet (_shared-styles.puml). Then move those retrieved files to corporate-only, replacing the broken ones you had from the attempted reconstruction (they have the wrong style sheet, for example: !theme plain)
