**User Message:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:

**User Message:** why is the /sl command (~/.claude/commands) suddenly generating and executing bash commands to read the contents of the last LSL files? Is /sl no longer an md-file?

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-19 04:45:14 UTC [06:45:14 CEST]

**User Message:** now, we were working on moving sensitive content which should not be included in the main public repo on the public github into a git submodule (corporate-only) which is a private repo on the public github. As such, when I check out the main nano-degree repo, I get everything, incl. the corporate only content. When someone else checks out nano-degree from the public github, they only get the main repo and sensitive content will not be shared. At the same time, the sensitive content is provided i...

**User Message:** what about 00_intro/llmapi.md?

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-19 04:54:54 UTC [06:54:54 CEST]

**User Message:** the llmapi.md needs split into a public version and a CN version and the CN part needs to go to the gh submodule (corporate-only). Otherwise, checking out the repo will bring the content to the dev machine (even if this is handled dynamically in the published github.io variant). Fix

**User Request:** you say that you narrated session 2 - but we are, again, missing the file. I suspect, the agent doesn't comprehend what file to write to... or you wrote to some other file? Investigate and fix, then resume

**Tool:** Read

### Task - 2025-08-27 21:48:03 UTC [23:48:03 CEST]

**User Request:** you say that you narrated session 2 - but we are, again, missing the file. I suspect, the agent doesn't comprehend what file to write to... or you wrote to some other file? Investigate and fix, then resume

**Tool:** Task
**Input:** ```json
{
  "subagent_type": "course-material-narrator",
  "description": "Actually write narrative to Session 2",
  "prompt": "You must ACTUALLY MODIFY the file at: /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/03_mcp-acp-a2a/Session2_FileSystem_MCP_Server.md\n\nThis is CRITICAL - you must write the enhanced content to the file, not just generate it.\n\nTransform Session 2 into an engaging learning experience with comprehensive narrative throughout the ENTIRE file. \n\nContext from the broader module:\n- Session 0: Introduced MCP, ACP, and A2A as the communication revolution\n- Session 1: Built first MCP server (weather) - learned basic protocol patterns  \n- THIS SESSION 2: Building secure file system access - the most dangerous and important MCP capability\n- Session 3: Will integrate MCP servers with LangChain for agent orchestration\n- Sessions 4-5: Production deployment and advanced security\n- Sessions 6-9: Agent-to-agent communication protocols\n\nSession 2's critical role: This is where students learn that MCP isn't just about safe APIs like weather - it can handle the most dangerous operations (file system access) while maintaining security. This teaches the security mindset essential for all future sessions.\n\nRequirements:\n1. ACTUALLY WRITE TO THE FILE - don't just generate content\n2. Add narrative throughout the ENTIRE file, not just at the beginning\n3. Explain the significance of each code block and security pattern\n4. Connect each implementation detail to the broader security architecture  \n5. Show how this prepares students for production deployment in Sessions 4-5\n6. Maintain professional tone without childish enthusiasm\n7. Preserve ALL technical content, code examples, tests, and exercises exactly as they are\n8. Make security feel like engineering excellence, not fear-based restrictions\n\nYou MUST modify the actual file. Verify that you are writing to: /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/03_mcp-acp-a2a/Session2_FileSystem_MCP_Server.md"
