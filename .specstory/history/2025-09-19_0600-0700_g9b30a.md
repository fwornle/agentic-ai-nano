### User

coder-detailed.md uses images which, of if not also used in coder.md (and, as such, public), should be moved to corporate-only and encrypted

### Assistant

You're absolutely right! Let me check which images are used in coder-detailed.md and see if they need to be moved to the corporate-only directory:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "grep -o \"images/[^)]*\" docs-content/corporate-only/00_intro/coder-detailed.md | sort -u",
  "description": "Find all image references in coder-detailed.md"
}
```

### User

**Result:** ❌ Error

### Assistant

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/corporate-only/00_intro/coder-detailed.md",
  "limit": 50
}

     5→## Overview: Developing in the BMW Cloud
     6→
     7→The Agentic AI Nano-Degree leverages **Coder**, a cloud development environment platform deployed within the BMW corporate network, to provide instant, consistent, and secure development workspaces. This eliminates the traditional friction of local environment setup, dependency conflicts, and corporate network complexity - both technical and procedural - that often delay or derail learning initiatives.

    11→
    12→Within the context of this nano-degree, an AWS cloud room has been set up (inside the corporate network for easy access to process resources) and controlled access to the Internet (through the corporate network firewall).

    15→*Figure 2: Standard cloud development room configuration*
    16→
    17→All relevant ports have been configured and firewall settings have been chosen to allow you to work with the libraries used by this course. This way, you should experience minimal friction due to the added complexity and limitations of a corporate environment.

    22→The cloud room runs an AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to deploy workloads. Coder uses this service to run your dev-containers.

    24→## Cluster Resources
    25→
    26→The nano-degree infrastructure provides:
    27→
    28→- **Elastic Scaling**: Resources adjust to demand  
    29→- **GPU Availability**: For training and inference workloads  
    30→- **Persistent Storage**: Your work is saved between sessions  
    31→- **Network Isolation**: Secure, private development spaces  
    32→
    33→## Why Cloud Development?
    34→
    35→### Traditional Challenges in Corporate Environments
    36→
    37→Corporate developers and learners typically face:
    38→
    39→- **Tool Installation Restrictions**: IT policies blocking software installations  
    40→- **Network Limitations**: Firewalls preventing package downloads  
    41→- **Version Conflicts**: Incompatible Python versions, library dependencies  
    42→- **Platform Inconsistencies**: Windows vs Mac vs Linux differences  
    43→- **Resource Constraints**: Limited local computing power for AI workloads  
    44→
    45→Cloud development environments solve these challenges by:
    46→
    47→- **Pre-configured Environments**: All tools, dependencies, and configurations ready-to-use  
    48→- **Browser-Based Access**: Work from any device within the VPN  
    49→- **Consistent Experience**: Identical environment for all participants  
    50→- **Scalable Resources**: Cloud computing power for intensive AI/ML workloads

### Assistant

Let me check what images are referenced throughout coder-detailed.md:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "grep \"images/\" docs-content/corporate-only/00_intro/coder-detailed.md | grep -o \"images/[^)]*\" | sort -u",
  "description": "Extract all image filenames from coder-detailed.md"
}
```

### User

**Result:** ❌ Error

Error

### Assistant

Let me check if the file exists and search for images differently:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la docs-content/corporate-only/00_intro/",
  "description": "Check if corporate coder-detailed exists"
}
```

### User

**Result:** ❌ Error

### Assistant

It seems the corporate-only directory doesn't exist. Let me find where the coder-detailed.md file actually is:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "find . -name \"coder-detailed.md\" -type f",
  "description": "Find coder-detailed.md file location"
}
```

### User

**Result:** ✅ Success

### Assistant

Let me check what files we have created:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la | grep -E \"corporate|coder\"",
  "description": "Check for corporate and coder files"
}
```

### User

  "command": "ls -la 00_intro/",
  "description": "Check 00_intro directory"
}
```

### User

### Assistant

Now let me check what images are referenced in coder.md vs what would be in coder-detailed.md. Let me look for all image references in coder.md:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "grep -o \"\\!\\[.*\\](.*)\" docs-content/00_intro/coder.md | sed 's/.*](//' | sed 's/).*//' | sort -u",
  "description": "Extract all image paths from coder.md"
}
```

### User

**Result:** ❌ Error

Error

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "grep \"\\.png\\|\\.jpg\" docs-content/00_intro/coder.md",
  "description": "Find image references in coder.md"
}
```

### User

**Result:** ✅ Success

No result content

### Assistant

Let me try a different approach:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Grep
**Input:** ```json
{
  "pattern": "images/",
  "path": "docs-content/00_intro/coder.md",
  "output_mode": "content"
}
```

### User

**Result:** ✅ Success
