### User Prompt - 2025-09-10T04:31:14.510Z

**Request:** so, now the voice is working. However, the display still "doesn't work" in light mode (works in dark mode) - on closer inspection, it seems to be just an unfortunte selection of colors - white on white... [Image #1]). In addition, when changing any of the controls, the narrative resets and starts over. At the same time, an "interrupt" error is thrown (see console in the screenshot). It would be better, if the narrative continued when changing the volume etd. Also, you seem to have included a cat...

**Request:** the controls no longer reset the narrative (= good) and we have an acceptable selection of voices. However, the volume now doesn't change at all anymore and the jump forward/backward buttons don't seem to work as expected (it jumps forward, never backwards + the highlighting disappears when jumping. Expectation: jump forward just moves the highlighted section forward by one step and re-starts the narrative from the beginning of that block. Backwards the same. It would also be nice to see what yo...

### User Prompt - 2025-09-10T05:01:39.688Z

**Request:** The last change introduced the following regressions: jump forward/backward stops the playback and one has to press play again to play that next/previous paragraph. Also, the chapters/captions are read out, even when the option has been deselected. Also, the displayed text now jumps up and down by a line... this might have to do with the requested highlighting of the word(s) you are currently reading.\
also, can something be done about the inflection of the voices? They still seeem rather unnatu...

### User Prompt - 2025-09-10T05:14:39.507Z

**Request:** Still no Cello and no Gollum voice. Also, the speed/volume no longer takes any effect (= regression). Plus, in this situation [Image #1], there is no pause between reading out the first highlighted paragraph (Duration...) and the next one to be read (after the skipped headings). So, skipping headings/captions appears to also remove the pause.

### User Prompt - 2025-09-10T05:22:42.963Z

**Request:** the live session log / transcript monitoring is currently spitting out transcripts with broken information: mostly my prompt followed by a non-descriptive "**Analysis:** ðŸ“‹ General activity" --> why are you no longer producing proper logs (with tool calls, results, ...)?
