**Work Period:** 1400-1500
**Focus:** Live session logging
**Duration:** ~60 minutes

## Session Overview

This session captures real-time tool interactions and exchanges.

## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-10-19 12:33:33 UTC [14:33:33 CEST]

**User Message:** Warmup

**Assistant Response:** I'm ready to assist with file search and code navigation tasks for the nano-degree project. I have a clear understanding of the critical guidelines, particularly:

1. **No parallel versions** - always fix originals, never create v2/enhanced/etc versions
2. **Mandatory verification** - always verify results with actual command output before claiming success
3. **Proper tool usage** - use appropriate tools for the job (Glob for patterns, Grep for searching, Read for known files, Bash for operation...

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd",
  "description": "Get current working directory to determine project"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
