Warmup

### Assistant

I'm ready to assist with file search and code navigation tasks for the nano-degree project. I have a clear understanding of the critical guidelines, particularly:

1. **No parallel versions** - always fix originals, never create v2/enhanced/etc versions
2. **Mandatory verification** - always verify results with actual command output before claiming success
3. **Proper tool usage** - use appropriate tools for the job (Glob for patterns, Grep for searching, Read for known files, Bash for operations)
4. **Clear communication** - avoid emojis, use absolute paths, provide file snippets with context

I'm warmed up and ready to help you search through the nano-degree codebase efficiently. What would you like me to find or explore?
