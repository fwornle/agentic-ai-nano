The last line suggests that there should be some logging file 2030-2130... but it is missing. Not sure, where you stored this information (path missing). Also, you issue this message at the very end, after a 5-10 seconds delay during which the user doesn't know what's going on. We need some info there before you start this lengthy process, so that ppl know what's going on. What is it that takes 5-10 seconds on shutdown?

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json

The last line suggests that there should be some logging file 2030-2130... but it is missing. Not sure, where you stored this information (path missing). Also, you issue this message at the very end, after a 5-10 seconds delay during which the user doesn't know what's going on. We need some info there before you start this lengthy process, so that ppl know what's going on. What is it that takes 5-10 seconds on shutdown?

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/scripts/simple-post-session-logger.js",
  "offset": 95,
  "limit": 15
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
