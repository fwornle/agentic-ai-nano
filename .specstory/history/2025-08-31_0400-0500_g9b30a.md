### Text Exchange - 2025-08-31 02:39:07 UTC [04:39:07 CEST]

**User Message:** URGENT: You need to refactor the MASSIVE 378-line code block at the beginning of Session3_ModuleB_Advanced_Workflows.md

CRITICAL BLOCK TO REFACTOR:
- Lines 14-393: 378 lines (ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE - IMMEDIATE PRIORITY!)

This is one of the largest single code blocks in the entire codebase, starting right at the beginning of the file and making it completely inaccessible to students.

REFACTORING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. This 378-line block MUST be broken down immediately
2. Break it into logical segments ...

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-31 02:44:34 UTC [04:44:34 CEST]

**User Message:** now do module 02

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-31 02:45:53 UTC [04:45:53 CEST]

**User Message:** You need to refactor Session1_Basic_RAG_Implementation.md which has the most large code blocks in module 02 with 25 large blocks.

ANALYSIS SHOWS SIGNIFICANT ISSUES:
- 25 large code blocks (highest count in module 02!)
- Multiple blocks ranging from 23-43 lines each
- This is a foundational RAG implementation file that needs to be accessible

REFACTORING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Focus on breaking down all 25 large code blocks systematically
2. Break each large block into logical segments of 10-15 lines ...
