## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-20 09:53:18 UTC [11:53:18 CEST]

**User Message:** the sidebar controls of the MkDocs (published) sometimes don't work (not scrolling until after a page reload & overlapping the bottom nav bar at the end of the page): [Image #1]. Also, session 10 only opened on the second attempt. And the sidebar of session 10 does not exist - it seems like we are "still on session 9": [Image #2]. ultrathink and fix this - they might be MkDocs deficits

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-20 09:55:40 UTC [11:55:40 CEST]

**User Message:** should this not be updateMkDocsNavigationForCorporateContent("Session10...")? To keep it general and not hard-code "session10" everywhere?

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-20 09:57:33 UTC [11:57:33 CEST]

**User Message:** In the call to updateMkDocsNavigationForCorporateContent you hard-code "session10" - should this not come from a config? Should the nav-system not always check, if we are going to some corporate content and then react accordingly, instead of hard-coding specifics of the content?

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
