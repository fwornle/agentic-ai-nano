## Key Activities

### 17:34:28 - Exchange 1

**User:** why is the statusLine in two lines now? Why is the current window not shown as 1730-1830?

**Tools:** TodoWrite

### 17:44:02 - Exchange 2

**User:** that's the old UTC vs. our timezone issue (+2h) - fix the same way as you adjust this in the logging sessions (LSL file content)

**Assistant:** You're absolutely right! The time calculation is using UTC but we need local time, just like the LSL files do. The status line is showing 1930-2030 because it's calculating based on UTC time (19:44) instead of local time (17:44).
