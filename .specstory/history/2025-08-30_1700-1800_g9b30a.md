### Text Exchange - 2025-08-30 15:06:25 UTC [17:06:25 CEST]

**User Message:** when adding explanations, you often introduce closing code block brackets at the end of your text (```), even when what follows is not code, but regular text. Maybe this is because you do this as simple script rather than semantically - not sure. Either way, there needs to be a reliable step with which you detect these formatting mistakes and correct them, then check what large code blocks might remain and - if necessary - repeat until all code blocks have been broken down and explained.
