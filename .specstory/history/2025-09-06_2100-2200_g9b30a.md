## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-06 19:01:10 UTC [21:01:10 CEST]

**User Message:** when do you trigger trajectory updates?

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-06 19:05:05 UTC [21:05:05 CEST]

**User Message:** is there a log in which I can see when you trigger(ed) traj. updates? I don't think the mechanism works. When did you last update the trajectory of coding, for ex. and what triggered it? Also, should you not use the V2 file, if this is the most recent version of how to produce a trajectory? why are there two versions at all? Clean this up

**User Message:** you just accessed files in coding, yet the ->coding indicator did not show. Is this to be expected or a mistake? ⏺ Bash(find /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding -name "*trajectory*" -type f -exec stat -f "%m %N" {} \; | sort -n | tail -10)

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-06 19:33:36 UTC [21:33:36 CEST]

**User Message:** so, you just created a new session log file (2130-2230) - why is there no trajectory update?

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-06 19:44:53 UTC [21:44:53 CEST]

**User Message:** and when did I last commit this file in coding?

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-06 19:47:07 UTC [21:47:07 CEST]

**User Message:** but then, why does the updated trajectory file not show in the git change set (neither in coding nor in nano-degree)?

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-06 19:51:28 UTC [21:51:28 CEST]

**User Message:** you say that the trajectory in nano-degree got updated and is visible as changed in git... but where? q284340@LPTP2040249 nano-degree % git status

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-06 19:54:43 UTC [21:54:43 CEST]

**User Message:** but the script that produces the trajectory needs to make at least one change: the mention of what LSL file got integrated in the trajectory. So, with every new LSL file there should be a new trajectory. Maybe even include the "last updated: date/time" to be sure. It seems odd that running a semantic analysis on a trajectory file plus an always new LSL file should yield the EXACT same file. I reckon, there is a bug in this trajectory creating code. Also - why are there two scripts? Make sure the...

**User Message:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
I need to chronologically analyze this extensive conversation about fixing broken infrastructure systems in a development environment. Let me work through this systematically:

The conversation begins with the user asking about PNG files and PUML references, which leads to discovering spillover files between projects. The user then asks me to fix several broken sy...
