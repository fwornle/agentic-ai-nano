I can see the issue now! The terminal shows "Claude Code has been suspended. Run 'fg' to bring Claude Code back." and there's garbled output. Here's how to fix this:

1. **In the terminal with the garbled text, type:**
   ```
   reset
   ```
   Then press Enter. This will clear the terminal state.

2. **If that doesn't work, try:**
   ```
   stty sane
   ```
   Then press Enter.

3. **To bring Claude Code back from suspension:**
   ```
   fg
   ```

4. **If you still see issues, you can force-quit and restart:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to interrupt
   - Then type `exit` to close that terminal session
   - Open a new terminal and restart Claude Code with `claude`

The garbled characters you're seeing are control/escape sequences that got corrupted when Claude Code was suspended. The `reset` command should restore normal terminal operation.

Try the `reset` command first - that's usually the quickest fix for this type of terminal corruption.
