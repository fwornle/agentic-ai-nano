I can see the issue now! The terminal shows "Claude Code has been suspended. Run 'fg' to bring Claude Code back." and there's garbled output. Here's how to fix this:

1. **In the terminal with the garbled text, type:**
   ```
   reset
   ```
   Then press Enter. This will clear the terminal state.

2. **If that doesn't work, try:**
   ```
   stty sane
   ```
   Then press Enter.

3. **To bring Claude Code back from suspension:**
   ```
   fg
   ```

4. **If you still see issues, you can force-quit and restart:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to interrupt
   - Then type `exit` to close that terminal session
   - Open a new terminal and restart Claude Code with `claude`

The garbled characters you're seeing are control/escape sequences that got corrupted when Claude Code was suspended. The `reset` command should restore normal terminal operation.

Try the `reset` command first - that's usually the quickest fix for this type of terminal corruption.

none of this works, as CTRL+C doesn't get me back anymore... it's just translated into garbldigub

### Assistant

The terminal is completely corrupted and not accepting normal input. Here's how to recover:

**Option 1: Force close the terminal tab/window**
- **On macOS**: Press `Cmd+W` to close the terminal tab, or `Cmd+Q` to quit Terminal entirely
- **Then**: Open a new terminal window/tab

**Option 2: If you can't close the tab:**
- **Force quit Terminal entirely**: Press `Cmd+Option+Esc`, select Terminal, click "Force Quit"
- **Then**: Reopen Terminal from Applications or Spotlight

**Option 3: Kill the corrupted process:**
From another terminal window (if you have one), or open a new one:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pkill -f claude",
  "description": "Kill all Claude processes"
}
```

### User

**Result:** âœ… Success

No result content

### Assistant

**Once you have a clean terminal:**
1. Navigate back to your project: `cd /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree`
2. Restart Claude Code: `claude`

The corruption happened because Claude Code got suspended mid-output and the terminal state got scrambled. A fresh terminal session will fix this completely.
