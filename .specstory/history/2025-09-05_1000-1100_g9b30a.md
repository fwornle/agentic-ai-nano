**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to analyze the user's requests regarding transcript monitoring system issues and LSL (Live Session Logging) file problems.

The conversation starts with the user identifying that the transcript monitoring system isn't creating proper session files and that existing LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts. The user explicitly states two main issues:

1. The transcript monitor isn't creating current session files (should have 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 by now)
2. LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts from transcripts

The user emphasizes that I need to recreate all LSL files from actual transcript data, not made-up summaries, and that files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in a time window.

I've been working through debugging the transcript monitoring system, analyzing actual transcript files to determine which time windows had user activity, and preparing to recreate proper LSL files from the real transcript data.

The user's most recent message clarifies that empty time windows (with no user prompts) should not have files at all - "file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files."

Key technical work includes:
- Analyzing transcript files to find actual user prompt timestamps
- Identifying that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts)
- Discovering the enhanced transcript monitor has errors
- Need to stop current monitor and recreate LSL files properly from transcript data

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Debug transcript monitoring system**: User identified that the status line shows old session (0830-0930 ended) but should have created 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 session files by now since current time is 10:46
   - **Fix LSL files with "No context" user prompts**: User pointed out that existing LSL files contain "User Request: No context" instead of extracting the full, unabbreviated user prompts from the actual transcripts
   - **Recreate all today's LSL/trajectory files from actual transcripts**: User emphasized that LSL files should contain real transcript data, not "made-up format" or "hallucinated aggregates"
   - **Ensure proper time-window based content**: LSL files should only contain content from their specific time windows, and files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in that window
   - **Apply to both projects**: Fix both nano-degree and coding project LSL files

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches starting at XX:30
   - Claude transcript files stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directories
   - Enhanced transcript monitor for real-time session file creation
   - Cross-project content routing (nano-degree to coding when appropriate)
   - Session boundary detection based on user prompt timestamps
   - Time window analysis: only create files when user prompts exist in that window

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/analyze-transcript-timestamps.js`
      - Created to analyze transcript files and determine actual user prompt time ranges
      - Extracts user prompts with timestamps and groups them into 30-minute windows
      - **Code snippet**: 
        ```javascript
        // Calculate 30-minute window (XX:30 - (XX+1):30)
        const totalMinutes = prompt.hour * 60 + prompt.minute;
        const windowStart = Math.floor((totalMinutes + 30) / 60) * 60 - 30;
        const windowEnd = windowStart + 60;
        ```
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-nano-degree/96b3c7de-16cb-48f3-90d2-f926452f9523.jsonl`
      - Most recent transcript file (last modified 10:47 AM)
      - Contains 270 total messages with 105 user prompts
      - Shows activity in 0730-0830 (15 prompts), 0830-0930 (40 prompts), 0930-1030 (6 prompts), 1030-1130 (44 prompts)
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`
      - Currently running but has errors trying to create trajectory files
      - Shows in logs: "Error updating trajectory: ENOENT: no such file or directory"
      - Created enhanced monitoring with multi-project support but implementation has issues

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong transcript monitor running**: Found simplified-transcript-monitor.js (PID 9141) running instead of enhanced version
     - Fixed by killing old process and starting enhanced monitor
     - User feedback: "this didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange"
   - **Enhanced monitor looking in wrong directory**: Monitor was checking coding directory instead of nano-degree
     - Fixed by running from correct directory: `cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree`
   - **Session duration too restrictive**: Enhanced monitor rejected transcript files as "too old"
     - Fixed by increasing sessionDuration from 1800000ms to 7200000ms
   - **LSL files contain "No context"**: User pointed out that existing files have placeholder text instead of real user prompts
     - Not yet fixed - this is the current main issue to address
   - **Made-up LSL content**: User identified that LSL files contain summaries I created rather than actual transcript data
     - User feedback: "they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files"

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully analyzed transcript files to determine actual time windows with user activity
   - Identified that 0930-1030 window DOES need a file (has 6 user prompts)
   - Enhanced monitor is running but has trajectory creation errors
   - Need to stop current monitor and recreate all LSL files from scratch using actual transcript data

6. All user messages:
   - "several issues: (1) you are still displaying 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴0830-0930-session(ended) on the statusLine - by now you should have created 0930-1030 and/or 1030-1130... at least in project coding, as all our prompts were directed to coding (no nano-degree focus). This didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange (if at all - presumably... "the transcript monitor process" is not running or running in the wrong context, or something like this again... which you told me, would be gone after we reworked the system. --> check/debug and fix. (2) the latest available LSL's in nano-degree include "User Request:** No context" --> you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts. This was probably done when you reconstructed this file. Check all LSL's of today and fix this (re-reconstruct). Also create the missing LSL's / traj. files. Also check the LSL's of today in project coding - they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files. Also add the missing LSL's/traj. files in coding... make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates). Once all LSL's have been produces correctly, re-create the traj. files"
   - "note that, if there was no activity between 09:30 and 10:30, this file is not needed - file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor (has errors)
   - Delete incorrectly created session files with made-up content
   - Create a proper script to extract actual user prompts and responses from transcript files
   - Recreate all today's LSL files (0730-0830, 0830-0930, 0930-1030, 1030-1130) with real transcript data
   - Ensure LSL files contain full, unabbreviated user prompts from actual transcripts
   - Create corresponding trajectory files for all sessions
   - Apply the same process to both nano-degree and coding projects

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed analyzing the transcript files using the `analyze-transcript-timestamps.js` script and discovered that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts), contradicting the user's suggestion that this file might not be needed. The analysis revealed these required time windows with actual user activity:
   - 2025-09-05_0730-0830-session.md (15 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_0830-0930-session.md (40 user prompts)  
   - 2025-09-05_0930-1030-session.md (6 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_1030-1130-session.md (44 user prompts)

   The enhanced transcript monitor is currently running but showing errors in the logs about missing trajectory files. My todo list shows I was working on "Delete incorrectly created session files and stop enhanced monitor" as the next step.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor that's causing errors, then create a proper transcript-to-LSL conversion script that will extract the actual user prompts and tool interactions from the transcript files to recreate all today's LSL files with real data instead of the current "No context" placeholders. This directly addresses the user's main complaint: "you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts" and "make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates).".
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Bash - 2025-09-05 08:57:41 UTC [10:57:41 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to analyze the user's requests regarding transcript monitoring system issues and LSL (Live Session Logging) file problems.

The conversation starts with the user identifying that the transcript monitoring system isn't creating proper session files and that existing LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts. The user explicitly states two main issues:

1. The transcript monitor isn't creating current session files (should have 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 by now)
2. LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts from transcripts

The user emphasizes that I need to recreate all LSL files from actual transcript data, not made-up summaries, and that files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in a time window.

I've been working through debugging the transcript monitoring system, analyzing actual transcript files to determine which time windows had user activity, and preparing to recreate proper LSL files from the real transcript data.

The user's most recent message clarifies that empty time windows (with no user prompts) should not have files at all - "file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files."

Key technical work includes:
- Analyzing transcript files to find actual user prompt timestamps
- Identifying that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts)
- Discovering the enhanced transcript monitor has errors
- Need to stop current monitor and recreate LSL files properly from transcript data

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Debug transcript monitoring system**: User identified that the status line shows old session (0830-0930 ended) but should have created 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 session files by now since current time is 10:46
   - **Fix LSL files with "No context" user prompts**: User pointed out that existing LSL files contain "User Request: No context" instead of extracting the full, unabbreviated user prompts from the actual transcripts
   - **Recreate all today's LSL/trajectory files from actual transcripts**: User emphasized that LSL files should contain real transcript data, not "made-up format" or "hallucinated aggregates"
   - **Ensure proper time-window based content**: LSL files should only contain content from their specific time windows, and files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in that window
   - **Apply to both projects**: Fix both nano-degree and coding project LSL files

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches starting at XX:30
   - Claude transcript files stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directories
   - Enhanced transcript monitor for real-time session file creation
   - Cross-project content routing (nano-degree to coding when appropriate)
   - Session boundary detection based on user prompt timestamps
   - Time window analysis: only create files when user prompts exist in that window

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/analyze-transcript-timestamps.js`
      - Created to analyze transcript files and determine actual user prompt time ranges
      - Extracts user prompts with timestamps and groups them into 30-minute windows
      - **Code snippet**: 
        ```javascript
        // Calculate 30-minute window (XX:30 - (XX+1):30)
        const totalMinutes = prompt.hour * 60 + prompt.minute;
        const windowStart = Math.floor((totalMinutes + 30) / 60) * 60 - 30;
        const windowEnd = windowStart + 60;
        ```
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-nano-degree/96b3c7de-16cb-48f3-90d2-f926452f9523.jsonl`
      - Most recent transcript file (last modified 10:47 AM)
      - Contains 270 total messages with 105 user prompts
      - Shows activity in 0730-0830 (15 prompts), 0830-0930 (40 prompts), 0930-1030 (6 prompts), 1030-1130 (44 prompts)
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`
      - Currently running but has errors trying to create trajectory files
      - Shows in logs: "Error updating trajectory: ENOENT: no such file or directory"
      - Created enhanced monitoring with multi-project support but implementation has issues

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong transcript monitor running**: Found simplified-transcript-monitor.js (PID 9141) running instead of enhanced version
     - Fixed by killing old process and starting enhanced monitor
     - User feedback: "this didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange"
   - **Enhanced monitor looking in wrong directory**: Monitor was checking coding directory instead of nano-degree
     - Fixed by running from correct directory: `cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree`
   - **Session duration too restrictive**: Enhanced monitor rejected transcript files as "too old"
     - Fixed by increasing sessionDuration from 1800000ms to 7200000ms
   - **LSL files contain "No context"**: User pointed out that existing files have placeholder text instead of real user prompts
     - Not yet fixed - this is the current main issue to address
   - **Made-up LSL content**: User identified that LSL files contain summaries I created rather than actual transcript data
     - User feedback: "they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files"

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully analyzed transcript files to determine actual time windows with user activity
   - Identified that 0930-1030 window DOES need a file (has 6 user prompts)
   - Enhanced monitor is running but has trajectory creation errors
   - Need to stop current monitor and recreate all LSL files from scratch using actual transcript data

6. All user messages:
   - "several issues: (1) you are still displaying 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴0830-0930-session(ended) on the statusLine - by now you should have created 0930-1030 and/or 1030-1130... at least in project coding, as all our prompts were directed to coding (no nano-degree focus). This didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange (if at all - presumably... "the transcript monitor process" is not running or running in the wrong context, or something like this again... which you told me, would be gone after we reworked the system. --> check/debug and fix. (2) the latest available LSL's in nano-degree include "User Request:** No context" --> you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts. This was probably done when you reconstructed this file. Check all LSL's of today and fix this (re-reconstruct). Also create the missing LSL's / traj. files. Also check the LSL's of today in project coding - they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files. Also add the missing LSL's/traj. files in coding... make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates). Once all LSL's have been produces correctly, re-create the traj. files"
   - "note that, if there was no activity between 09:30 and 10:30, this file is not needed - file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor (has errors)
   - Delete incorrectly created session files with made-up content
   - Create a proper script to extract actual user prompts and responses from transcript files
   - Recreate all today's LSL files (0730-0830, 0830-0930, 0930-1030, 1030-1130) with real transcript data
   - Ensure LSL files contain full, unabbreviated user prompts from actual transcripts
   - Create corresponding trajectory files for all sessions
   - Apply the same process to both nano-degree and coding projects

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed analyzing the transcript files using the `analyze-transcript-timestamps.js` script and discovered that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts), contradicting the user's suggestion that this file might not be needed. The analysis revealed these required time windows with actual user activity:
   - 2025-09-05_0730-0830-session.md (15 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_0830-0930-session.md (40 user prompts)  
   - 2025-09-05_0930-1030-session.md (6 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_1030-1130-session.md (44 user prompts)

   The enhanced transcript monitor is currently running but showing errors in the logs about missing trajectory files. My todo list shows I was working on "Delete incorrectly created session files and stop enhanced monitor" as the next step.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor that's causing errors, then create a proper transcript-to-LSL conversion script that will extract the actual user prompts and tool interactions from the transcript files to recreate all today's LSL files with real data instead of the current "No context" placeholders. This directly addresses the user's main complaint: "you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts" and "make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates).".
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-05* 2>/dev/null || echo \"No coding session files found\"",

   - 2025-09-05_0830-0930-session.md (40 user prompts)  
   - 2025-09-05_0930-1030-session.md (6 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_1030-1130-session.md (44 user prompts)

   The enhanced transcript monitor is currently running but showing errors in the logs about missing trajectory files. My todo list shows I was working on "Delete incorrectly created session files and stop enhanced monitor" as the next step.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor that's causing errors, then create a proper transcript-to-LSL conversion script that will extract the actual user prompts and tool interactions from the transcript files to recreate all today's LSL files with real data instead of the current "No context" placeholders. This directly addresses the user's main complaint: "you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts" and "make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates).".
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to analyze the user's requests regarding transcript monitoring system issues and LSL (Live Session Logging) file problems.

The conversation starts with the user identifying that the transcript monitoring system isn't creating proper session files and that existing LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts. The user explicitly states two main issues:

1. The transcript monitor isn't creating current session files (should have 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 by now)
2. LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts from transcripts

The user emphasizes that I need to recreate all LSL files from actual transcript data, not made-up summaries, and that files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in a time window.

I've been working through debugging the transcript monitoring system, analyzing actual transcript files to determine which time windows had user activity, and preparing to recreate proper LSL files from the real transcript data.

The user's most recent message clarifies that empty time windows (with no user prompts) should not have files at all - "file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files."

Key technical work includes:
- Analyzing transcript files to find actual user prompt timestamps
- Identifying that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts)
- Discovering the enhanced transcript monitor has errors
- Need to stop current monitor and recreate LSL files properly from transcript data

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Debug transcript monitoring system**: User identified that the status line shows old session (0830-0930 ended) but should have created 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 session files by now since current time is 10:46
   - **Fix LSL files with "No context" user prompts**: User pointed out that existing LSL files contain "User Request: No context" instead of extracting the full, unabbreviated user prompts from the actual transcripts
   - **Recreate all today's LSL/trajectory files from actual transcripts**: User emphasized that LSL files should contain real transcript data, not "made-up format" or "hallucinated aggregates"
   - **Ensure proper time-window based content**: LSL files should only contain content from their specific time windows, and files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in that window
   - **Apply to both projects**: Fix both nano-degree and coding project LSL files

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches starting at XX:30
   - Claude transcript files stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directories
   - Enhanced transcript monitor for real-time session file creation
   - Cross-project content routing (nano-degree to coding when appropriate)
   - Session boundary detection based on user prompt timestamps
   - Time window analysis: only create files when user prompts exist in that window

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/analyze-transcript-timestamps.js`
      - Created to analyze transcript files and determine actual user prompt time ranges
      - Extracts user prompts with timestamps and groups them into 30-minute windows
      - **Code snippet**: 
        ```javascript
        // Calculate 30-minute window (XX:30 - (XX+1):30)
        const totalMinutes = prompt.hour * 60 + prompt.minute;
        const windowStart = Math.floor((totalMinutes + 30) / 60) * 60 - 30;
        const windowEnd = windowStart + 60;
        ```
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-nano-degree/96b3c7de-16cb-48f3-90d2-f926452f9523.jsonl`
      - Most recent transcript file (last modified 10:47 AM)
      - Contains 270 total messages with 105 user prompts
      - Shows activity in 0730-0830 (15 prompts), 0830-0930 (40 prompts), 0930-1030 (6 prompts), 1030-1130 (44 prompts)
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`
      - Currently running but has errors trying to create trajectory files
      - Shows in logs: "Error updating trajectory: ENOENT: no such file or directory"
      - Created enhanced monitoring with multi-project support but implementation has issues

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong transcript monitor running**: Found simplified-transcript-monitor.js (PID 9141) running instead of enhanced version
     - Fixed by killing old process and starting enhanced monitor
     - User feedback: "this didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange"
   - **Enhanced monitor looking in wrong directory**: Monitor was checking coding directory instead of nano-degree
     - Fixed by running from correct directory: `cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree`
   - **Session duration too restrictive**: Enhanced monitor rejected transcript files as "too old"
     - Fixed by increasing sessionDuration from 1800000ms to 7200000ms
   - **LSL files contain "No context"**: User pointed out that existing files have placeholder text instead of real user prompts
     - Not yet fixed - this is the current main issue to address
   - **Made-up LSL content**: User identified that LSL files contain summaries I created rather than actual transcript data
     - User feedback: "they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files"

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully analyzed transcript files to determine actual time windows with user activity
   - Identified that 0930-1030 window DOES need a file (has 6 user prompts)
   - Enhanced monitor is running but has trajectory creation errors
   - Need to stop current monitor and recreate all LSL files from scratch using actual transcript data

6. All user messages:
   - "several issues: (1) you are still displaying 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴0830-0930-session(ended) on the statusLine - by now you should have created 0930-1030 and/or 1030-1130... at least in project coding, as all our prompts were directed to coding (no nano-degree focus).

Also check the LSL's of today in project coding - they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files.

   - "note that, if there was no activity between 09:30 and 10:30, this file is not needed - file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor (has errors)
   - Delete incorrectly created session files with made-up content
   - Create a proper script to extract actual user prompts and responses from transcript files
   - Recreate all today's LSL files (0730-0830, 0830-0930, 0930-1030, 1030-1130) with real transcript data
   - Ensure LSL files contain full, unabbreviated user prompts from actual transcripts
   - Create corresponding trajectory files for all sessions
   - Apply the same process to both nano-degree and coding projects

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed analyzing the transcript files using the `analyze-transcript-timestamps.js` script and discovered that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts), contradicting the user's suggestion that this file might not be needed. The analysis revealed these required time windows with actual user activity:
   - 2025-09-05_0730-0830-session.md (15 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_0830-0930-session.md (40 user prompts)

Also add the missing LSL's/traj. files in coding... make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates). Once all LSL's have been produces correctly, re-create the traj. files"
   - "note that, if there was no activity between 09:30 and 10:30, this file is not needed - file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor (has errors)
   - Delete incorrectly created session files with made-up content
   - Create a proper script to extract actual user prompts and responses from transcript files
   - Recreate all today's LSL files (0730-0830, 0830-0930, 0930-1030, 1030-1130) with real transcript data
   - Ensure LSL files contain full, unabbreviated user prompts from actual transcripts
   - Create corresponding trajectory files for all sessions
   - Apply the same process to both nano-degree and coding projects

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed analyzing the transcript files using the `analyze-transcript-timestamps.js` script and discovered that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts), contradicting the user's suggestion that this file might not be needed. The analysis revealed these required time windows with actual user activity:
   - 2025-09-05_0730-0830-session.md (15 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_0830-0930-session.md (40 user prompts)  
   - 2025-09-05_0930-1030-session.md (6 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_1030-1130-session.md (44 user prompts)

   The enhanced transcript monitor is currently running but showing errors in the logs about missing trajectory files. My todo list shows I was working on "Delete incorrectly created session files and stop enhanced monitor" as the next step.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor that's causing errors, then create a proper transcript-to-LSL conversion script that will extract the actual user prompts and tool interactions from the transcript files to recreate all today's LSL files with real data instead of the current "No context" placeholders. This directly addresses the user's main complaint: "you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts" and "make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates).".

### Write - 2025-09-05 08:57:41 UTC [10:57:41 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to analyze the user's requests regarding transcript monitoring system issues and LSL (Live Session Logging) file problems.

The conversation starts with the user identifying that the transcript monitoring system isn't creating proper session files and that existing LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts. The user explicitly states two main issues:

1. The transcript monitor isn't creating current session files (should have 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 by now)
2. LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts from transcripts

The user emphasizes that I need to recreate all LSL files from actual transcript data, not made-up summaries, and that files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in a time window.

I've been working through debugging the transcript monitoring system, analyzing actual transcript files to determine which time windows had user activity, and preparing to recreate proper LSL files from the real transcript data.

The user's most recent message clarifies that empty time windows (with no user prompts) should not have files at all - "file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files."

Key technical work includes:
- Analyzing transcript files to find actual user prompt timestamps
- Identifying that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts)
- Discovering the enhanced transcript monitor has errors
- Need to stop current monitor and recreate LSL files properly from transcript data

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Debug transcript monitoring system**: User identified that the status line shows old session (0830-0930 ended) but should have created 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 session files by now since current time is 10:46
   - **Fix LSL files with "No context" user prompts**: User pointed out that existing LSL files contain "User Request: No context" instead of extracting the full, unabbreviated user prompts from the actual transcripts
   - **Recreate all today's LSL/trajectory files from actual transcripts**: User emphasized that LSL files should contain real transcript data, not "made-up format" or "hallucinated aggregates"
   - **Ensure proper time-window based content**: LSL files should only contain content from their specific time windows, and files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in that window
   - **Apply to both projects**: Fix both nano-degree and coding project LSL files

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches starting at XX:30
   - Claude transcript files stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directories
   - Enhanced transcript monitor for real-time session file creation
   - Cross-project content routing (nano-degree to coding when appropriate)
   - Session boundary detection based on user prompt timestamps
   - Time window analysis: only create files when user prompts exist in that window

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/analyze-transcript-timestamps.js`
      - Created to analyze transcript files and determine actual user prompt time ranges
      - Extracts user prompts with timestamps and groups them into 30-minute windows
      - **Code snippet**: 
        ```javascript
        // Calculate 30-minute window (XX:30 - (XX+1):30)
        const totalMinutes = prompt.hour * 60 + prompt.minute;
        const windowStart = Math.floor((totalMinutes + 30) / 60) * 60 - 30;
        const windowEnd = windowStart + 60;
        ```
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-nano-degree/96b3c7de-16cb-48f3-90d2-f926452f9523.jsonl`
      - Most recent transcript file (last modified 10:47 AM)
      - Contains 270 total messages with 105 user prompts
      - Shows activity in 0730-0830 (15 prompts), 0830-0930 (40 prompts), 0930-1030 (6 prompts), 1030-1130 (44 prompts)
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`
      - Currently running but has errors trying to create trajectory files
      - Shows in logs: "Error updating trajectory: ENOENT: no such file or directory"
      - Created enhanced monitoring with multi-project support but implementation has issues

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong transcript monitor running**: Found simplified-transcript-monitor.js (PID 9141) running instead of enhanced version
     - Fixed by killing old process and starting enhanced monitor
     - User feedback: "this didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange"
   - **Enhanced monitor looking in wrong directory**: Monitor was checking coding directory instead of nano-degree
     - Fixed by running from correct directory: `cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree`
   - **Session duration too restrictive**: Enhanced monitor rejected transcript files as "too old"
     - Fixed by increasing sessionDuration from 1800000ms to 7200000ms
   - **LSL files contain "No context"**: User pointed out that existing files have placeholder text instead of real user prompts
     - Not yet fixed - this is the current main issue to address
   - **Made-up LSL content**: User identified that LSL files contain summaries I created rather than actual transcript data
     - User feedback: "they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files"

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully analyzed transcript files to determine actual time windows with user activity
   - Identified that 0930-1030 window DOES need a file (has 6 user prompts)
   - Enhanced monitor is running but has trajectory creation errors
   - Need to stop current monitor and recreate all LSL files from scratch using actual transcript data

6. All user messages:
   - "several issues: (1) you are still displaying 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴0830-0930-session(ended) on the statusLine - by now you should have created 0930-1030 and/or 1030-1130... at least in project coding, as all our prompts were directed to coding (no nano-degree focus). This didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange (if at all - presumably... "the transcript monitor process" is not running or running in the wrong context, or something like this again... which you told me, would be gone after we reworked the system. --> check/debug and fix. (2) the latest available LSL's in nano-degree include "User Request:** No context" --> you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts. This was probably done when you reconstructed this file. Check all LSL's of today and fix this (re-reconstruct). Also create the missing LSL's / traj. files. Also check the LSL's of today in project coding - they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files.

   - "note that, if there was no activity between 09:30 and 10:30, this file is not needed - file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files"

7. Pending Tasks:

   - Delete incorrectly created session files with made-up content
   - Create a proper script to extract actual user prompts and responses from transcript files
   - Recreate all today's LSL files (0730-0830, 0830-0930, 0930-1030, 1030-1130) with real transcript data
   - Ensure LSL files contain full, unabbreviated user prompts from actual transcripts
   - Create corresponding trajectory files for all sessions
   - Apply the same process to both nano-degree and coding projects

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed analyzing the transcript files using the `analyze-transcript-timestamps.js` script and discovered that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts), contradicting the user's suggestion that this file might not be needed.

   The enhanced transcript monitor is currently running but showing errors in the logs about missing trajectory files. My todo list shows I was working on "Delete incorrectly created session files and stop enhanced monitor" as the next step.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to analyze the user's requests regarding transcript monitoring system issues and LSL (Live Session Logging) file problems.

The conversation starts with the user identifying that the transcript monitoring system isn't creating proper session files and that existing LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts. The user explicitly states two main issues:

1. The transcript monitor isn't creating current session files (should have 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 by now)
2. LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts from transcripts

The user emphasizes that I need to recreate all LSL files from actual transcript data, not made-up summaries, and that files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in a time window.

I've been working through debugging the transcript monitoring system, analyzing actual transcript files to determine which time windows had user activity, and preparing to recreate proper LSL files from the real transcript data.

The user's most recent message clarifies that empty time windows (with no user prompts) should not have files at all - "file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files."

Key technical work includes:
- Analyzing transcript files to find actual user prompt timestamps
- Identifying that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts)
- Discovering the enhanced transcript monitor has errors
- Need to stop current monitor and recreate LSL files properly from transcript data

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Debug transcript monitoring system**: User identified that the status line shows old session (0830-0930 ended) but should have created 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 session files by now since current time is 10:46
   - **Fix LSL files with "No context" user prompts**: User pointed out that existing LSL files contain "User Request: No context" instead of extracting the full, unabbreviated user prompts from the actual transcripts
   - **Recreate all today's LSL/trajectory files from actual transcripts**: User emphasized that LSL files should contain real transcript data, not "made-up format" or "hallucinated aggregates"
   - **Ensure proper time-window based content**: LSL files should only contain content from their specific time windows, and files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in that window
   - **Apply to both projects**: Fix both nano-degree and coding project LSL files

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches starting at XX:30
   - Claude transcript files stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directories
   - Enhanced transcript monitor for real-time session file creation
   - Cross-project content routing (nano-degree to coding when appropriate)
   - Session boundary detection based on user prompt timestamps
   - Time window analysis: only create files when user prompts exist in that window

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/analyze-transcript-timestamps.js`
      - Created to analyze transcript files and determine actual user prompt time ranges
      - Extracts user prompts with timestamps and groups them into 30-minute windows
      - **Code snippet**: 
        ```javascript
        // Calculate 30-minute window (XX:30 - (XX+1):30)
        const totalMinutes = prompt.hour * 60 + prompt.minute;
        const windowStart = Math.floor((totalMinutes + 30) / 60) * 60 - 30;
        const windowEnd = windowStart + 60;
        ```
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-nano-degree/96b3c7de-16cb-48f3-90d2-f926452f9523.jsonl`
      - Most recent transcript file (last modified 10:47 AM)
      - Contains 270 total messages with 105 user prompts
      - Shows activity in 0730-0830 (15 prompts), 0830-0930 (40 prompts), 0930-1030 (6 prompts), 1030-1130 (44 prompts)
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`
      - Currently running but has errors trying to create trajectory files
      - Shows in logs: "Error updating trajectory: ENOENT: no such file or directory"
      - Created enhanced monitoring with multi-project support but implementation has issues

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong transcript monitor running**: Found simplified-transcript-monitor.js (PID 9141) running instead of enhanced version
     - Fixed by killing old process and starting enhanced monitor
     - User feedback: "this didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange"
   - **Enhanced monitor looking in wrong directory**: Monitor was checking coding directory instead of nano-degree
     - Fixed by running from correct directory: `cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree`
   - **Session duration too restrictive**: Enhanced monitor rejected transcript files as "too old"
     - Fixed by increasing sessionDuration from 1800000ms to 7200000ms
   - **LSL files contain "No context"**: User pointed out that existing files have placeholder text instead of real user prompts
     - Not yet fixed - this is the current main issue to address
   - **Made-up LSL content**: User identified that LSL files contain summaries I created rather than actual transcript data
     - User feedback: "they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files"

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully analyzed transcript files to determine actual time windows with user activity
   - Identified that 0930-1030 window DOES need a file (has 6 user prompts)
   - Enhanced monitor is running but has trajectory creation errors
   - Need to stop current monitor and recreate all LSL files from scratch using actual transcript data

6. All user messages:
   - "several issues: (1) you are still displaying 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴0830-0930-session(ended) on the statusLine - by now you should have created 0930-1030 and/or 1030-1130... at least in project coding, as all our prompts were directed to coding (no nano-degree focus). This didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange (if at all - presumably...

This was probably done when you reconstructed this file. Check all LSL's of today and fix this (re-reconstruct). Also create the missing LSL's / traj. files. Also check the LSL's of today in project coding - they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files. Also add the missing LSL's/traj. files in coding... make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates).

   - "note that, if there was no activity between 09:30 and 10:30, this file is not needed - file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor (has errors)
   - Delete incorrectly created session files with made-up content
   - Create a proper script to extract actual user prompts and responses from transcript files
   - Recreate all today's LSL files (0730-0830, 0830-0930, 0930-1030, 1030-1130) with real transcript data
   - Ensure LSL files contain full, unabbreviated user prompts from actual transcripts
   - Create corresponding trajectory files for all sessions
   - Apply the same process to both nano-degree and coding projects

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed analyzing the transcript files using the `analyze-transcript-timestamps.js` script and discovered that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts), contradicting the user's suggestion that this file might not be needed. The analysis revealed these required time windows with actual user activity:
   - 2025-09-05_0730-0830-session.md (15 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_0830-0930-session.md (40 user prompts)  
   - 2025-09-05_0930-1030-session.md (6 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_1030-1130-session.md (44 user prompts)

   The enhanced transcript monitor is currently running but showing errors in the logs about missing trajectory files. My todo list shows I was working on "Delete incorrectly created session files and stop enhanced monitor" as the next step.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor that's causing errors, then create a proper transcript-to-LSL conversion script that will extract the actual user prompts and tool interactions from the transcript files to recreate all today's LSL files with real data instead of the current "No context" placeholders. This directly addresses the user's main complaint: "you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts" and "make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates).".
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to analyze the user's requests regarding transcript monitoring system issues and LSL (Live Session Logging) file problems.

The conversation starts with the user identifying that the transcript monitoring system isn't creating proper session files and that existing LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts. The user explicitly states two main issues:

1. The transcript monitor isn't creating current session files (should have 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 by now)
2. LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts from transcripts

The user emphasizes that I need to recreate all LSL files from actual transcript data, not made-up summaries, and that files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in a time window.

I've been working through debugging the transcript monitoring system, analyzing actual transcript files to determine which time windows had user activity, and preparing to recreate proper LSL files from the real transcript data.

The user's most recent message clarifies that empty time windows (with no user prompts) should not have files at all - "file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files."

Key technical work includes:
- Analyzing transcript files to find actual user prompt timestamps
- Identifying that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts)

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to analyze the user's requests regarding transcript monitoring system issues and LSL (Live Session Logging) file problems.

The conversation starts with the user identifying that the transcript monitoring system isn't creating proper session files and that existing LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts. The user explicitly states two main issues:

1. The transcript monitor isn't creating current session files (should have 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 by now)
2. LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts from transcripts

The user emphasizes that I need to recreate all LSL files from actual transcript data, not made-up summaries, and that files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in a time window.

I've been working through debugging the transcript monitoring system, analyzing actual transcript files to determine which time windows had user activity, and preparing to recreate proper LSL files from the real transcript data.

The user's most recent message clarifies that empty time windows (with no user prompts) should not have files at all - "file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files."

Key technical work includes:
- Analyzing transcript files to find actual user prompt timestamps
- Identifying that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts)
- Discovering the enhanced transcript monitor has errors
- Need to stop current monitor and recreate LSL files properly from transcript data

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Debug transcript monitoring system**: User identified that the status line shows old session (0830-0930 ended) but should have created 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 session files by now since current time is 10:46
   - **Fix LSL files with "No context" user prompts**: User pointed out that existing LSL files contain "User Request: No context" instead of extracting the full, unabbreviated user prompts from the actual transcripts
   - **Recreate all today's LSL/trajectory files from actual transcripts**: User emphasized that LSL files should contain real transcript data, not "made-up format" or "hallucinated aggregates"
   - **Ensure proper time-window based content**: LSL files should only contain content from their specific time windows, and files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in that window
   - **Apply to both projects**: Fix both nano-degree and coding project LSL files

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches starting at XX:30
   - Claude transcript files stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directories
   - Enhanced transcript monitor for real-time session file creation
   - Cross-project content routing (nano-degree to coding when appropriate)
   - Session boundary detection based on user prompt timestamps
   - Time window analysis: only create files when user prompts exist in that window

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/analyze-transcript-timestamps.js`
      - Created to analyze transcript files and determine actual user prompt time ranges
      - Extracts user prompts with timestamps and groups them into 30-minute windows
      - **Code snippet**: 
        ```javascript
        // Calculate 30-minute window (XX:30 - (XX+1):30)
        const totalMinutes = prompt.hour * 60 + prompt.minute;
        const windowStart = Math.floor((totalMinutes + 30) / 60) * 60 - 30;
        const windowEnd = windowStart + 60;
        ```
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-nano-degree/96b3c7de-16cb-48f3-90d2-f926452f9523.jsonl`
      - Most recent transcript file (last modified 10:47 AM)
      - Contains 270 total messages with 105 user prompts
      - Shows activity in 0730-0830 (15 prompts), 0830-0930 (40 prompts), 0930-1030 (6 prompts), 1030-1130 (44 prompts)
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`
      - Currently running but has errors trying to create trajectory files
      - Shows in logs: "Error updating trajectory: ENOENT: no such file or directory"
      - Created enhanced monitoring with multi-project support but implementation has issues

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong transcript monitor running**: Found simplified-transcript-monitor.js (PID 9141) running instead of enhanced version
     - Fixed by killing old process and starting enhanced monitor
     - User feedback: "this didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange"
   - **Enhanced monitor looking in wrong directory**: Monitor was checking coding directory instead of nano-degree
     - Fixed by running from correct directory: `cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree`
   - **Session duration too restrictive**: Enhanced monitor rejected transcript files as "too old"
     - Fixed by increasing sessionDuration from 1800000ms to 7200000ms
   - **LSL files contain "No context"**: User pointed out that existing files have placeholder text instead of real user prompts
     - Not yet fixed - this is the current main issue to address
   - **Made-up LSL content**: User identified that LSL files contain summaries I created rather than actual transcript data
     - User feedback: "they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files"

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully analyzed transcript files to determine actual time windows with user activity
   - Identified that 0930-1030 window DOES need a file (has 6 user prompts)
   - Enhanced monitor is running but has trajectory creation errors
   - Need to stop current monitor and recreate all LSL files from scratch using actual transcript data

6. All user messages:
   - "several issues: (1) you are still displaying 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴0830-0930-session(ended) on the statusLine - by now you should have created 0930-1030 and/or 1030-1130... at least in project coding, as all our prompts were directed to coding (no nano-degree focus). This didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange (if at all - presumably... "the transcript monitor process" is not running or running in the wrong context, or something like this again... which you told me, would be gone after we reworked the system. --> check/debug and fix. (2) the latest available LSL's in nano-degree include "User Request:** No context" --> you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts. This was probably done when you reconstructed this file. Check all LSL's of today and fix this (re-reconstruct). Also create the missing LSL's / traj. files. Also check the LSL's of today in project coding - they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files. Also add the missing LSL's/traj. files in coding... make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates). Once all LSL's have been produces correctly, re-create the traj. files"
   - "note that, if there was no activity between 09:30 and 10:30, this file is not needed - file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor (has errors)
   - Delete incorrectly created session files with made-up content
   - Create a proper script to extract actual user prompts and responses from transcript files
   - Recreate all today's LSL files (0730-0830, 0830-0930, 0930-1030, 1030-1130) with real transcript data
   - Ensure LSL files contain full, unabbreviated user prompts from actual transcripts
   - Create corresponding trajectory files for all sessions
   - Apply the same process to both nano-degree and coding projects

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed analyzing the transcript files using the `analyze-transcript-timestamps.js` script and discovered that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts), contradicting the user's suggestion that this file might not be needed. The analysis revealed these required time windows with actual user activity:
   - 2025-09-05_0730-0830-session.md (15 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_0830-0930-session.md (40 user prompts)  
   - 2025-09-05_0930-1030-session.md (6 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_1030-1130-session.md (44 user prompts)

   The enhanced transcript monitor is currently running but showing errors in the logs about missing trajectory files. My todo list shows I was working on "Delete incorrectly created session files and stop enhanced monitor" as the next step.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor that's causing errors, then create a proper transcript-to-LSL conversion script that will extract the actual user prompts and tool interactions from the transcript files to recreate all today's LSL files with real data instead of the current "No context" placeholders. This directly addresses the user's main complaint: "you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts" and "make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates).".
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed analyzing the transcript files using the `analyze-transcript-timestamps.js` script and discovered that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts), contradicting the user's suggestion that this file might not be needed. The analysis revealed these required time windows with actual user activity:
   - 2025-09-05_0730-0830-session.md (15 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_0830-0930-session.md (40 user prompts)  
   - 2025-09-05_0930-1030-session.md (6 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_1030-1130-session.md (44 user prompts)

   The enhanced transcript monitor is currently running but showing errors in the logs about missing trajectory files. My todo list shows I was working on "Delete incorrectly created session files and stop enhanced monitor" as the next step.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor that's causing errors, then create a proper transcript-to-LSL conversion script that will extract the actual user prompts and tool interactions from the transcript files to recreate all today's LSL files with real data instead of the current "No context" placeholders. This directly addresses the user's main complaint: "you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts" and "make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates).".
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to analyze the user's requests regarding transcript monitoring system issues and LSL (Live Session Logging) file problems.

The conversation starts with the user identifying that the transcript monitoring system isn't creating proper session files and that existing LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts. The user explicitly states two main issues:

1. The transcript monitor isn't creating current session files (should have 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 by now)
2. LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts from transcripts

The user emphasizes that I need to recreate all LSL files from actual transcript data, not made-up summaries, and that files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in a time window.

I've been working through debugging the transcript monitoring system, analyzing actual transcript files to determine which time windows had user activity, and preparing to recreate proper LSL files from the real transcript data.

The user's most recent message clarifies that empty time windows (with no user prompts) should not have files at all - "file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files."

Key technical work includes:
- Analyzing transcript files to find actual user prompt timestamps
- Identifying that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts)
- Discovering the enhanced transcript monitor has errors
- Need to stop current monitor and recreate LSL files properly from transcript data

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Debug transcript monitoring system**: User identified that the status line shows old session (0830-0930 ended) but should have created 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 session files by now since current time is 10:46
   - **Fix LSL files with "No context" user prompts**: User pointed out that existing LSL files contain "User Request: No context" instead of extracting the full, unabbreviated user prompts from the actual transcripts
   - **Recreate all today's LSL/trajectory files from actual transcripts**: User emphasized that LSL files should contain real transcript data, not "made-up format" or "hallucinated aggregates"
   - **Ensure proper time-window based content**: LSL files should only contain content from their specific time windows, and files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in that window
   - **Apply to both projects**: Fix both nano-degree and coding project LSL files

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches starting at XX:30
   - Claude transcript files stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directories
   - Enhanced transcript monitor for real-time session file creation
   - Cross-project content routing (nano-degree to coding when appropriate)
   - Session boundary detection based on user prompt timestamps
   - Time window analysis: only create files when user prompts exist in that window

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/analyze-transcript-timestamps.js`
      - Created to analyze transcript files and determine actual user prompt time ranges
      - Extracts user prompts with timestamps and groups them into 30-minute windows
      - **Code snippet**: 
        ```javascript
        // Calculate 30-minute window (XX:30 - (XX+1):30)
        const totalMinutes = prompt.hour * 60 + prompt.minute;
        const windowStart = Math.floor((totalMinutes + 30) / 60) * 60 - 30;
        const windowEnd = windowStart + 60;
        ```
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-nano-degree/96b3c7de-16cb-48f3-90d2-f926452f9523.jsonl`
      - Most recent transcript file (last modified 10:47 AM)
      - Contains 270 total messages with 105 user prompts
      - Shows activity in 0730-0830 (15 prompts), 0830-0930 (40 prompts), 0930-1030 (6 prompts), 1030-1130 (44 prompts)
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`
      - Currently running but has errors trying to create trajectory files
      - Shows in logs: "Error updating trajectory: ENOENT: no such file or directory"
      - Created enhanced monitoring with multi-project support but implementation has issues

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong transcript monitor running**: Found simplified-transcript-monitor.js (PID 9141) running instead of enhanced version
     - Fixed by killing old process and starting enhanced monitor
     - User feedback: "this didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange"
   - **Enhanced monitor looking in wrong directory**: Monitor was checking coding directory instead of nano-degree
     - Fixed by running from correct directory: `cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree`
   - **Session duration too restrictive**: Enhanced monitor rejected transcript files as "too old"
     - Fixed by increasing sessionDuration from 1800000ms to 7200000ms
   - **LSL files contain "No context"**: User pointed out that existing files have placeholder text instead of real user prompts
     - Not yet fixed - this is the current main issue to address
   - **Made-up LSL content**: User identified that LSL files contain summaries I created rather than actual transcript data
     - User feedback: "they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files"

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully analyzed transcript files to determine actual time windows with user activity
   - Identified that 0930-1030 window DOES need a file (has 6 user prompts)
   - Enhanced monitor is running but has trajectory creation errors
   - Need to stop current monitor and recreate all LSL files from scratch using actual transcript data

6. All user messages:
   - "several issues: (1) you are still displaying 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴0830-0930-session(ended) on the statusLine - by now you should have created 0930-1030 and/or 1030-1130... at least in project coding, as all our prompts were directed to coding (no nano-degree focus). This didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange (if at all - presumably... "the transcript monitor process" is not running or running in the wrong context, or something like this again... which you told me, would be gone after we reworked the system. --> check/debug and fix. (2) the latest available LSL's in nano-degree include "User Request:** No context" --> you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts. This was probably done when you reconstructed this file. Check all LSL's of today and fix this (re-reconstruct). Also create the missing LSL's / traj. files. Also check the LSL's of today in project coding - they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files. Also add the missing LSL's/traj. files in coding... make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates). Once all LSL's have been produces correctly, re-create the traj. files"
   - "note that, if there was no activity between 09:30 and 10:30, this file is not needed - file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor (has errors)
   - Delete incorrectly created session files with made-up content
   - Create a proper script to extract actual user prompts and responses from transcript files
   - Recreate all today's LSL files (0730-0830, 0830-0930, 0930-1030, 1030-1130) with real transcript data
   - Ensure LSL files contain full, unabbreviated user prompts from actual transcripts
   - Create corresponding trajectory files for all sessions
   - Apply the same process to both nano-degree and coding projects

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed analyzing the transcript files using the `analyze-transcript-timestamps.js` script and discovered that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts), contradicting the user's suggestion that this file might not be needed.

   - 2025-09-05_1030-1130-session.md (44 user prompts)

   The enhanced transcript monitor is currently running but showing errors in the logs about missing trajectory files. My todo list shows I was working on "Delete incorrectly created session files and stop enhanced monitor" as the next step.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to analyze the user's requests regarding transcript monitoring system issues and LSL (Live Session Logging) file problems.

The conversation starts with the user identifying that the transcript monitoring system isn't creating proper session files and that existing LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts. The user explicitly states two main issues:

1. The transcript monitor isn't creating current session files (should have 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 by now)
2. LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts from transcripts

The user emphasizes that I need to recreate all LSL files from actual transcript data, not made-up summaries, and that files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in a time window.

I've been working through debugging the transcript monitoring system, analyzing actual transcript files to determine which time windows had user activity, and preparing to recreate proper LSL files from the real transcript data.

The user's most recent message clarifies that empty time windows (with no user prompts) should not have files at all - "file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files."

Key technical work includes:
- Analyzing transcript files to find actual user prompt timestamps
- Identifying that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts)
- Discovering the enhanced transcript monitor has errors
- Need to stop current monitor and recreate LSL files properly from transcript data

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Debug transcript monitoring system**: User identified that the status line shows old session (0830-0930 ended) but should have created 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 session files by now since current time is 10:46
   - **Fix LSL files with "No context" user prompts**: User pointed out that existing LSL files contain "User Request: No context" instead of extracting the full, unabbreviated user prompts from the actual transcripts
   - **Recreate all today's LSL/trajectory files from actual transcripts**: User emphasized that LSL files should contain real transcript data, not "made-up format" or "hallucinated aggregates"
   - **Ensure proper time-window based content**: LSL files should only contain content from their specific time windows, and files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in that window
   - **Apply to both projects**: Fix both nano-degree and coding project LSL files

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches starting at XX:30
   - Claude transcript files stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directories
   - Enhanced transcript monitor for real-time session file creation
   - Cross-project content routing (nano-degree to coding when appropriate)
   - Session boundary detection based on user prompt timestamps
   - Time window analysis: only create files when user prompts exist in that window

   - "several issues: (1) you are still displaying 🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋🔴0830-0930-session(ended) on the statusLine - by now you should have created 0930-1030 and/or 1030-1130... at least in project coding, as all our prompts were directed to coding (no nano-degree focus).

This was probably done when you reconstructed this file. Check all LSL's of today and fix this (re-reconstruct). Also create the missing LSL's / traj. files. Also check the LSL's of today in project coding - they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files. Also add the missing LSL's/traj. files in coding... make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates). Once all LSL's have been produces correctly, re-create the traj. files"
   - "note that, if there was no activity between 09:30 and 10:30, this file is not needed - file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor (has errors)
   - Delete incorrectly created session files with made-up content
   - Create a proper script to extract actual user prompts and responses from transcript files
   - Recreate all today's LSL files (0730-0830, 0830-0930, 0930-1030, 1030-1130) with real transcript data
   - Ensure LSL files contain full, unabbreviated user prompts from actual transcripts
   - Create corresponding trajectory files for all sessions
   - Apply the same process to both nano-degree and coding projects

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed analyzing the transcript files using the `analyze-transcript-timestamps.js` script and discovered that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts), contradicting the user's suggestion that this file might not be needed. The analysis revealed these required time windows with actual user activity:
   - 2025-09-05_0730-0830-session.md (15 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_0830-0930-session.md (40 user prompts)  
   - 2025-09-05_0930-1030-session.md (6 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_1030-1130-session.md (44 user prompts)

   The enhanced transcript monitor is currently running but showing errors in the logs about missing trajectory files. My todo list shows I was working on "Delete incorrectly created session files and stop enhanced monitor" as the next step.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor that's causing errors, then create a proper transcript-to-LSL conversion script that will extract the actual user prompts and tool interactions from the transcript files to recreate all today's LSL files with real data instead of the current "No context" placeholders. This directly addresses the user's main complaint: "you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts" and "make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates).".
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to analyze the user's requests regarding transcript monitoring system issues and LSL (Live Session Logging) file problems.

The conversation starts with the user identifying that the transcript monitoring system isn't creating proper session files and that existing LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts. The user explicitly states two main issues:

1. The transcript monitor isn't creating current session files (should have 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 by now)
2. LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts from transcripts

The user emphasizes that I need to recreate all LSL files from actual transcript data, not made-up summaries, and that files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in a time window.

I've been working through debugging the transcript monitoring system, analyzing actual transcript files to determine which time windows had user activity, and preparing to recreate proper LSL files from the real transcript data.

The user's most recent message clarifies that empty time windows (with no user prompts) should not have files at all - "file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files."

Key technical work includes:
- Analyzing transcript files to find actual user prompt timestamps
- Identifying that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts)
- Discovering the enhanced transcript monitor has errors
- Need to stop current monitor and recreate LSL files properly from transcript data

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Debug transcript monitoring system**: User identified that the status line shows old session (0830-0930 ended) but should have created 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 session files by now since current time is 10:46
   - **Fix LSL files with "No context" user prompts**: User pointed out that existing LSL files contain "User Request: No context" instead of extracting the full, unabbreviated user prompts from the actual transcripts
   - **Recreate all today's LSL/trajectory files from actual transcripts**: User emphasized that LSL files should contain real transcript data, not "made-up format" or "hallucinated aggregates"
   - **Ensure proper time-window based content**: LSL files should only contain content from their specific time windows, and files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in that window
   - **Apply to both projects**: Fix both nano-degree and coding project LSL files

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches starting at XX:30
   - Claude transcript files stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directories
   - Enhanced transcript monitor for real-time session file creation
   - Cross-project content routing (nano-degree to coding when appropriate)
   - Session boundary detection based on user prompt timestamps
   - Time window analysis: only create files when user prompts exist in that window

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/analyze-transcript-timestamps.js`
      - Created to analyze transcript files and determine actual user prompt time ranges
      - Extracts user prompts with timestamps and groups them into 30-minute windows
      - **Code snippet**: 
        ```javascript
        // Calculate 30-minute window (XX:30 - (XX+1):30)
        const totalMinutes = prompt.hour * 60 + prompt.minute;
        const windowStart = Math.floor((totalMinutes + 30) / 60) * 60 - 30;
        const windowEnd = windowStart + 60;
        ```
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-nano-degree/96b3c7de-16cb-48f3-90d2-f926452f9523.jsonl`
      - Most recent transcript file (last modified 10:47 AM)
      - Contains 270 total messages with 105 user prompts
      - Shows activity in 0730-0830 (15 prompts), 0830-0930 (40 prompts), 0930-1030 (6 prompts), 1030-1130 (44 prompts)
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`
      - Currently running but has errors trying to create trajectory files
      - Shows in logs: "Error updating trajectory: ENOENT: no such file or directory"
      - Created enhanced monitoring with multi-project support but implementation has issues

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong transcript monitor running**: Found simplified-transcript-monitor.js (PID 9141) running instead of enhanced version
     - Fixed by killing old process and starting enhanced monitor
     - User feedback: "this didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange"
   - **Enhanced monitor looking in wrong directory**: Monitor was checking coding directory instead of nano-degree
     - Fixed by running from correct directory: `cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree`
   - **Session duration too restrictive**: Enhanced monitor rejected transcript files as "too old"
     - Fixed by increasing sessionDuration from 1800000ms to 7200000ms
   - **LSL files contain "No context"**: User pointed out that existing files have placeholder text instead of real user prompts
     - Not yet fixed - this is the current main issue to address
   - **Made-up LSL content**: User identified that LSL files contain summaries I created rather than actual transcript data
     - User feedback: "they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files"

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully analyzed transcript files to determine actual time windows with user activity
   - Identified that 0930-1030 window DOES need a file (has 6 user prompts)
   - Enhanced monitor is running but has trajectory creation errors
   - Need to stop current monitor and recreate all LSL files from scratch using actual transcript data

     - Fixed by killing old process and starting enhanced monitor
     - User feedback: "this didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange"
   - **Enhanced monitor looking in wrong directory**: Monitor was checking coding directory instead of nano-degree
     - Fixed by running from correct directory: `cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree`
   - **Session duration too restrictive**: Enhanced monitor rejected transcript files as "too old"
     - Fixed by increasing sessionDuration from 1800000ms to 7200000ms
   - **LSL files contain "No context"**: User pointed out that existing files have placeholder text instead of real user prompts
     - Not yet fixed - this is the current main issue to address
   - **Made-up LSL content**: User identified that LSL files contain summaries I created rather than actual transcript data
     - User feedback: "they don't appear to be logged transcript files, but some made-up format you invented when re-constructing these files"

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully analyzed transcript files to determine actual time windows with user activity
   - Identified that 0930-1030 window DOES need a file (has 6 user prompts)
   - Enhanced monitor is running but has trajectory creation errors
   - Need to stop current monitor and recreate all LSL files from scratch using actual transcript data

   - Ensure LSL files contain full, unabbreviated user prompts from actual transcripts
   - Create corresponding trajectory files for all sessions
   - Apply the same process to both nano-degree and coding projects

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed analyzing the transcript files using the `analyze-transcript-timestamps.js` script and discovered that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts), contradicting the user's suggestion that this file might not be needed. The analysis revealed these required time windows with actual user activity:
   - 2025-09-05_0730-0830-session.md (15 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_0830-0930-session.md (40 user prompts)  
   - 2025-09-05_0930-1030-session.md (6 user prompts)
   - 2025-09-05_1030-1130-session.md (44 user prompts)

   The enhanced transcript monitor is currently running but showing errors in the logs about missing trajectory files. My todo list shows I was working on "Delete incorrectly created session files and stop enhanced monitor" as the next step.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Stop the current enhanced transcript monitor that's causing errors, then create a proper transcript-to-LSL conversion script that will extract the actual user prompts and tool interactions from the transcript files to recreate all today's LSL files with real data instead of the current "No context" placeholders. This directly addresses the user's main complaint: "you failed to extract the (full, unabreviated) user prompts from the transcripts" and "make sure the LSL's include the right prompts (window dependent) and are in the right format (from the transcripts, not hallucinated aggregates).".

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to analyze the user's requests regarding transcript monitoring system issues and LSL (Live Session Logging) file problems.

The conversation starts with the user identifying that the transcript monitoring system isn't creating proper session files and that existing LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts. The user explicitly states two main issues:

1. The transcript monitor isn't creating current session files (should have 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 by now)
2. LSL files contain "No context" instead of actual user prompts from transcripts

The user emphasizes that I need to recreate all LSL files from actual transcript data, not made-up summaries, and that files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in a time window.

I've been working through debugging the transcript monitoring system, analyzing actual transcript files to determine which time windows had user activity, and preparing to recreate proper LSL files from the real transcript data.

The user's most recent message clarifies that empty time windows (with no user prompts) should not have files at all - "file creation is always upon receiving a user prompt in a particular window. Empty windows have no files."

Key technical work includes:
- Analyzing transcript files to find actual user prompt timestamps
- Identifying that there ARE user prompts in the 0930-1030 window (6 prompts)
- Discovering the enhanced transcript monitor has errors
- Need to stop current monitor and recreate LSL files properly from transcript data

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Debug transcript monitoring system**: User identified that the status line shows old session (0830-0930 ended) but should have created 0930-1030 and 1030-1130 session files by now since current time is 10:46
   - **Fix LSL files with "No context" user prompts**: User pointed out that existing LSL files contain "User Request: No context" instead of extracting the full, unabbreviated user prompts from the actual transcripts
   - **Recreate all today's LSL/trajectory files from actual transcripts**: User emphasized that LSL files should contain real transcript data, not "made-up format" or "hallucinated aggregates"
   - **Ensure proper time-window based content**: LSL files should only contain content from their specific time windows, and files should only be created when there are actual user prompts in that window
   - **Apply to both projects**: Fix both nano-degree and coding project LSL files

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Live Session Logging (LSL) system with 60-minute time tranches starting at XX:30
   - Claude transcript files stored in `~/.claude/projects/` directories
   - Enhanced transcript monitor for real-time session file creation
   - Cross-project content routing (nano-degree to coding when appropriate)
   - Session boundary detection based on user prompt timestamps
   - Time window analysis: only create files when user prompts exist in that window

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/analyze-transcript-timestamps.js`
      - Created to analyze transcript files and determine actual user prompt time ranges
      - Extracts user prompts with timestamps and groups them into 30-minute windows
      - **Code snippet**: 
        ```javascript
        // Calculate 30-minute window (XX:30 - (XX+1):30)
        const totalMinutes = prompt.hour * 60 + prompt.minute;
        const windowStart = Math.floor((totalMinutes + 30) / 60) * 60 - 30;
        const windowEnd = windowStart + 60;
        ```
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-nano-degree/96b3c7de-16cb-48f3-90d2-f926452f9523.jsonl`
      - Most recent transcript file (last modified 10:47 AM)
      - Contains 270 total messages with 105 user prompts
      - Shows activity in 0730-0830 (15 prompts), 0830-0930 (40 prompts), 0930-1030 (6 prompts), 1030-1130 (44 prompts)
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`
      - Currently running but has errors trying to create trajectory files
      - Shows in logs: "Error updating trajectory: ENOENT: no such file or directory"
      - Created enhanced monitoring with multi-project support but implementation has issues

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Wrong transcript monitor running**: Found simplified-transcript-monitor.js (PID 9141) running instead of enhanced version
     - Fixed by killing old process and starting enhanced monitor
     - User feedback: "this didn't happen. In fact, it is unclear where you logged the current exchange"
