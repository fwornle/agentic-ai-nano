# Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- All sessions are logged locally in the current project's .specstory/history directory
- For multiple sessions, start with most recent and work backwards
- Focus on understanding the project context and previous work completed


**Assistant:** *(8/28/2025, 3:39:56 PM)*
I'll read the latest session log file to establish continuity from previous work.

**Assistant:** *(8/28/2025, 3:40:28 PM)*
Based on the recent commits and project structure, I can see this is the **nano-degree** project - an agentic AI nanodegree curriculum. The recent commits show extensive work on "fixing heading structure and long-wound business titles and captions" across the course materials.

## Project Context Summary

**Current State**: The nano-degree project contains comprehensive course materials for three main modules:
1. **Agent Frameworks** (01_frameworks/) - 10+ sessions covering various AI agent frameworks
2. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** (02_rag/) - 9+ sessions on RAG systems  
3. **MCP/ACP/A2A Communication** (03_mcp-acp-a2a/) - 9+ sessions on agent communication protocols

**Recent Work**: The recent commits indicate significant work on course material formatting, specifically fixing heading structures and verbose business language that was making the content tedious to follow.

**Project Infrastructure**: 
- Well-structured documentation with PlantUML diagrams
- Complete source code examples for each session
- Test solutions and advanced modules
- Docker deployment setup
- MkDocs documentation system

The project appears to be in active maintenance mode, focusing on improving the readability and structure of the educational content. No immediate tasks are pending based on the current session.

**User:** *(8/28/2025, 3:42:40 PM)*
review all sessions and optional module files in all three course modules (01-03) to ensure that the multiple-choice test is formatted as follows:\
## Multiple Choice Test - Session 0

Test your understanding of agent frameworks and patterns:

**Question 1:** Which agentic pattern involves an agent evaluating and improving its own outputs?  
A) Multi-Agent  
B) Planning  
C) Tool Use  
D) Reflection  \
\
(some use headings for the label "Question 1" and another heading for the actual question... messing up the sidebar in the MkDocs. Also, there must be 2 spaces after the question and two spaces after each answer. Also the answers follow in the line directly after the question. Fix ALL tests in ALL md-files!

**Assistant:** *(8/28/2025, 3:42:45 PM)*
I'll review and fix all multiple choice test formats across all three course modules. Let me start by creating a todo list and then systematically examine each file.

Search through all files in the 01_frameworks, 02_rag, and 03_mcp-acp-a2a directories to find multiple choice test questions that have formatting issues. Specifically look for:

1. Questions that use heading formats like "### Question 1" or "#### Question 1" instead of "**Question 1:**"
2. Questions where the question text is on a separate line with its own heading
3. Missing double spaces after questions (should be 2 spaces)
4. Missing double spaces after answer options (should be 2 spaces)
5. Answer options that don't start immediately on the line after the question

Please search through all .md files and provide a comprehensive list of files that have these formatting issues, along with examples of the problematic patterns found.

**Assistant:** *(8/28/2025, 3:43:22 PM)*
I'll search through the specified directories to find multiple choice test questions with formatting issues. Let me start by exploring the directory structure and then search for question patterns.
