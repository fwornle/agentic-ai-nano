With enterprises reporting a 35-45% increase in resolution rates using multi-agent designs over single-agent bots, LangGraph powers mission-critical systems at Replit, Uber, LinkedIn, and GitLab. The platform went Generally Available in May 2025, marking its transition from experimental to enterprise-ready infrastructure.\n\n### What You'll Learn & Why It Matters\n\nYou'll master graph-based workflow orchestration, learn the state management patterns that enable complex agent coordination, and understand conditional routing for dynamic decision-making. More importantly, you'll discover why 51% of teams already run agents in production choose graph-based architectures for reliability and observability.\n\n### How LangGraph Stands Out\n\nLangGraph's stateful, graph-driven reasoning engines with first-class tracing represent a major advancement over simple chain-based systems. Its sophisticated orchestration layer acts as a conductor, coordinating how agents interact, sequence tasks, share context, and respond to failures within a structured but flexible framework.\n\n### Real-World Applications & Production Evidence\n\nLangGraph excels in complex workflows requiring coordination between multiple specialized agents.
