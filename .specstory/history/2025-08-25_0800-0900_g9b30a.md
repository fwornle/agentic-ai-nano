### Text Exchange - 2025-08-25 06:07:02 UTC [08:07:02 CEST]

**User Message:** the LLM page is there (Gaia)... when you are in public, go to LLM, then log into the CN and press reload. However, you cannot reach it in a normal way, as the sidebar entry LLM API isn't showing (still) in CN mode on the Setup & Env page

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-25 06:15:21 UTC [08:15:21 CEST]

**User Message:** what have you done?! now you made BMW stuff appear on the public page (which was fine before)... and it still doesn't work in CN mode. Why is this so difficult?! Revert the last change (to fix the public site), then make sure you copy the exact logic of the public site to CN --> there is a sidebar with two main entries (dev env & llm) and they are either public content or CN content (depending on the login state). Why does this take you 40 attempts?! Any junior programmer would have done this in...

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-25 06:28:57 UTC [08:28:57 CEST]

**User Message:** stopped you because you tried to push to origin (instead of origin-main). I did the push myself (manually, outside Claude). We are now back to the version where you show the BMW sidebare entries in public mode (wrong). Check the history of this session to see how you fixed this and re-apply the fix. [Image #1]

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-25 06:39:47 UTC [08:39:47 CEST]

**User Message:** It now seems to work, minus the fact that the LLM API is not showing in the sidebar of the Setup & Env page in CN mode. You can see that you (correctly) hide the public LLM API entry... but there should be a (visible) CN LLM API entry - check the code that produces the sidebar(s). I think you are not fully in control of this code... seems, every time you thouch it something else breaks. How can this be so complicated to fix such a trivial thing? [Image #1]

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-25 06:56:25 UTC [08:56:25 CEST]

**User Message:** you don't need to do local builds of mkdocs to test it - I do this in the remote (CI). Is there a way to remove the redundant heading (Public LLM API Config)? You seem to use this to distinguish it from BMW LLM API Config). If you cannot avoid this, at least rename it to CN LLM API Config, so we won't need to see "BMW" flash up while you are checking for CN-vs-public (the latter takes a noticable time during which you display all sidebar menus. Maybe you could also find a way to avoid this? (eg....

**User Message:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation about fixing a documentation website with conditional content display:

The conversation starts with the user reporting issues with a MkDocs Material website that has network detection (BMW corporate vs public) but sidebar navigation items showing incorrectly. The main problem is BMW sidebar items showing in public ...
