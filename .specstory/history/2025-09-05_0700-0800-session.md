## Key Activities

### 07:02:25 - Exchange 1

**Assistant:** Now I need to filter out PNG files in puml subdirectories and find all markdown files to search for image references:

### 07:16:15 - Exchange 2

**Assistant:** The trajectory system is now properly fixed! The key improvements:

✅ **Cross-date predecessor detection** - Finds the most recent previous trajectory regardless of date
✅ **Cumulative session numbering** - Session #7, not daily resets
✅ **Time gap awareness** - Shows "10-hour gap" between sessions
✅ **Continuity preservation** - "Building on accumulated learning from 6 previous sessions"

Regarding the half-hour marks (0630 vs 0702) - you're right, it could start at the actual time, but the consistent XX:30 boundaries do make it easier to read and manage.

### 07:56:35 - Exchange 5

**Assistant:** Now I'll create the missing 0730-0830 session files that should have been automatically created. This current conversation (starting from the user's observation about the missing files) belongs in the 0730-0830 window:
