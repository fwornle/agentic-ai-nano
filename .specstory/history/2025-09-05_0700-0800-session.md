**User Message:**

you got stuck in an API error and I had to restart. This was your last output: ⏺ ✅ MODULE 03 CODE BLOCK ANALYSIS COMPLETE

  I've successfully adjusted both analyzer scripts for Module 03 and generated a comprehensive analysis
  report. Here are the key findings:

  📊 Critical Statistics:

  - 364 total code blocks across 32 files
  - 155 blocks (42.6%) exceed 20 lines - critically high
  - Average block length: 35.4 lines - nearly double the target
  - Longest block: 691 lines - extremely problematic
  - All 10 sessions affected - systematic issue

  🚨 Most Critical Issues:

  1. Session 8: 691-line mega-block (Advanced Workflows)
  2. Session 7: 582-line block (Agent Communication)
  3. Session 4: 307-line block (Production Deployment)
  4. Session 3: 306-line and 290-line blocks (LangChain Integration)

  �� Comparison to Module 01:

  - Module 01: ~10% blocks over 20 lines ✅
  - Module 03: 42.6% blocks over 20 lines 🚨
  - Educational Impact: Severely compromised learning flow

  📋 Generated Reports:

  1. module_03_code_block_analysis_report.md - Comprehensive strategic analysis
  2. mcp_adk_a2a_code_block_analysis.txt - Detailed technical findings

  🎯 Key Recommendations:

  Phase 1: Critical (Immediate)

  - Break 691-line Session 8 block into 8-10 focused examples
  - Restructure 582-line Session 7 communication patterns
  - Address 300+ line blocks in Sessions 3-4

  Phase 2: Systematic (Week 1-2)

  - Move complex implementations to src/ directories
  - Keep session content to 15-20 line conceptual examples
  - Create proper cross-references

  Phase 3: <USER_ID_REDACTED> Assurance

  - Target: Zero blocks over 20 lines
  - Maintain educational depth through modular architecture
  - Achieve Module 01 <USER_ID_REDACTED> standards

  🏆 Progress Summary:

  - ✅ Sessions 8-9 src/ implementations completed
  - ✅ Analysis and reporting completed
  - ✅ Strategic roadmap defined
  - ⏳ Session content updates pending
  - ⏳ Integration testing pending

  The analysis reveals that Module 03 requires immediate comprehensive restructuring to achieve educational
  <USER_ID_REDACTED> standards, with a clear roadmap now established for systematic improvement.

> use this report to break up ALL blocks that are too big. Each block shall be explained so that the student 
  can easily follow along the narrative of the chapter / session. Once ALL blocks have been reduced to 
  acceptable sizes and explained properly, go over the entire module and ensure that the overall narrative is 
  coherent and flows along elegantly. Use sub-agents where you see fit

⏺ I'll systematically break up all oversized code blocks in Module 03 and ensure a coherent narrative flow.
  Given the scope (155 blocks over 20 lines), I'll use specialized sub-agents to handle different aspects
  efficiently.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze module structure and identify all oversized blocks 
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 0 oversized blocks (5 blocks)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 1 oversized blocks (5 blocks)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 2 oversized blocks (10 blocks)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 3 oversized blocks (7 blocks)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 4 oversized blocks (16 blocks)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 5 oversized blocks (11 blocks)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 6 oversized blocks (1 block)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 7 oversized blocks (5 blocks)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 8 oversized blocks (11 blocks)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 9 oversized blocks (19 blocks)
     ☐ Review and enhance overall module narrative flow
     ☐ Final validation of all code blocks and narrative coherence

⏺ Now I'll launch multiple specialized agents to handle this comprehensive restructuring task efficiently:

⏺ code-refactoring-specialist(Restructure Session 0-2 blocks)
  ⎿  Done (35 tool uses · 96.0k tokens · 10m 13.0s)                                                           

  Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze module structure and identify all oversized blocks 
     ☒ Break up and explain Session 0 oversized blocks (5 blocks)
     ☒ Break up and explain Session 1 oversized blocks (5 blocks)

     ☐ Break up and explain Session 3 oversized blocks (7 blocks)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 4 oversized blocks (16 blocks)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 5 oversized blocks (11 blocks)
     ☐ Break up and explain Session 6 oversized blocks (1 block)

     ☐ Break up and explain Session 9 oversized blocks (19 blocks)
     ☐ Review and enhance overall module narrative flow
     ☐ Final validation of all code blocks and narrative coherence

⏺ Now let me continue with Sessions 3-5, which contain some of the largest blocks:
  ⎿  API Error (Request timed out.) · Retrying in 1 seconds… (attempt 1/10)
  ⎿  API Error (Request timed out.) · Retrying in 1 seconds… (attempt 2/10)

  ⎿  API Error (Request timed out.) · Retrying in 32 seconds… (attempt 10/10)
. Now resume

**Claude Response:**

I'll continue where we left off - Sessions 0-2 have been completed, now I need to tackle Sessions 3-9 which contain the most problematic oversized blocks. Let me create a focused todo list and continue the restructuring work.

Now I'll launch specialized agents to efficiently handle the remaining sessions with the most critical oversized blocks:

**Tool Calls:**

**TodoWrite**: Tool executed
**Task**: Restructure Session 3 blocks
**Task**: Restructure Session 4 blocks

**Tool Results:**

Todos have been modified successfully. Ensure that you continue to use the todo list to track your progress. Please proceed with the current tasks if applicable

### User Request 4 - 09/10/2025, 07:18 CEST (2025-09-10 05:18:39 UTC)

**User Message:**

and why are the podcast controls shown in dark colors even though we are in light mode?

**Claude Response:**

You're right! Let me fix the light mode colors. The issue is that I set the podcast player to always use dark background, but it should adapt to the current theme.

Now I need to update the text colors and control styles for light mode:

Now let me fix the content display area:

Now let me fix the control buttons and labels for light mode:

Let me also fix the hover states and other elements:

Let me also fix the control labels and selectors for light mode:

Now let me fix the select dropdowns for light mode:

Perfect! Now the podcast player should display correctly in light mode with:

## ✅ Light Mode Colors Fixed

- **Background**: Light gray gradient instead of dark blue
- **Text**: Dark gray (#333) instead of white
- **Borders**: Dark borders instead of white
- **Controls**: Dark buttons with proper contrast
- **Labels**: Dark text for all labels and descriptions
- **Dropdowns**: Light background with dark text
- **Hover effects**: Appropriate for light theme

The player now properly adapts to both light and dark themes:

- **Light mode**: Light background, dark text/controls
- **Dark mode**: Dark background, white text/controls (via `[data-md-color-scheme="slate"]`)

Refresh the page and you should see the podcast controls with proper light mode styling that matches the rest of the interface!

### User Request 5 - 09/10/2025, 07:30 CEST (2025-09-10 05:30:49 UTC)

**User Message:**

while slightly better, the light mode controls still have some white on white issues. Plus some errors in the console [Image #1]. Plus, the controls speed and volumes are not doing anything anymore

**Claude Response:**

I can see the light mode controls still have visibility issues with white text on light backgrounds, and there are console errors. Let me fix the CSS for better light mode contrast and check the speed/volume functionality.

Now let me fix the speed and volume functionality. Let me check the JavaScript code for these controls:

Let me check the implementation of the changeSpeed and changeVolume methods:

The speed/volume methods look correct. Let me check if the issue is in the playCurrentChunk method where these values should be applied:

I found the issue! The volume and rate are being set in the utterance setup, but I need to see exactly where. Let me check the full playCurrentChunk method around the utterance configuration:

Let me find where the utterance voice, volume, and rate are set:

I can see the issue! The code is correctly setting `this.utterance.rate = this.playbackRate` but it's conditional based on heading detection. Let me look at the console errors from the screenshot more closely. Let me also fix the minimize button styling for light mode:

Now let me ensure the volume and speed controls are actually properly linked by adding debug logging to the JavaScript:

Let me also ensure the rate is always properly set in playCurrentChunk by simplifying the logic:

Now let me clean up the duplicate pitch setting that was left over:

Perfect! The fixes are now complete:

✅ **Light Mode CSS Fixed:**
- Player title and subtitle now have proper dark text on light backgrounds
- Content title and progress text improved with better contrast  
- Labels now have dark text with proper weight for visibility
- Voice/speed selectors have white backgrounds with dark text and borders
- Minimize button has proper light mode styling with hover effects

✅ **Speed/Volume Controls Enhanced:**
- Added debug logging to track when speed/volume changes are requested
- Improved immediate application of changes to current utterance
- Enhanced logging for utterance settings to help debug any issues
- Cleaned up duplicate pitch setting code

The podcast TTS system should now work properly with:
- Clear visibility in both light and dark modes
- Functioning speed and volume controls that apply immediately
- Proper debugging information in the console
- All novelty voices (Cellos, Bubbles, etc.) available in dropdown

The system is ready for testing with improved contrast and functionality!

**Claude Response:**

Not stuck - I was about to enhance the file. Let me update the Session 0 file with detailed explanations for each of the 5 agentic patterns based on the insights from the PDF:

Perfect! I've successfully enhanced Session 0 with detailed explanations for all 5 agentic patterns based on the insights from the PDF document. Here's what was added:

## Summary of Enhancements:

### Pattern 1: Reflection
- Added explanation of how it addresses the "sounds good but something's off" problem
- Included the concept of giving the model a "pause button and mirror"
- Added practical implementation example with evaluation prompts

### Pattern 2: Tool Use  
- Explained how LLMs don't need to know everything, just how to fetch what they need
- Listed common tool integrations (vector DBs, APIs, code execution, etc.)
- Added production implementation example with function calling

### Pattern 3: ReAct
- Detailed the Reasoning + Acting iterative loop
- Explained how it transforms agents from reactive responders to navigators
- Included real-world example with invoice searching
- Added production class implementation showing error handling

### Pattern 4: Planning
- Emphasized that "intelligence lives in the process, not just the answers"
- Showed how agents move from reactive to proactive
- Included product launch example with structured steps
- Added advanced implementation with dynamic replanning

### Pattern 5: Multi-Agent
- Highlighted that "magic happens when agents disagree"
- Listed typical agent roles (Researcher, Planner, Coder, Reviewer, PM)
- Showed collaboration dynamics and communication patterns
- Added comprehensive implementation example with parallel processing

Each pattern now has:
- Clear problem statement it solves
- Conceptual explanation
- Practical code examples
- Real-world use cases
- Benefits and implementation requirements

The enhancements maintain the educational structure while adding the depth and practical insights from Paolo Perrone's article about why these patterns actually work in production systems.

    98→Every agent framework implements these fundamental patterns:
    99→
   100→![Overview of LLM Patterns](images/agentic-5-patterns.png)
   101→
   102→#### Pattern 1: Reflection (3 minutes)
   103→
   104→**Purpose**: Self-improvement through self-evaluation
   105→
   106→The Reflection pattern addresses a fundamental challenge: LLMs often produce outputs that "sound good" but may have subtle errors or miss important aspects. By implementing a self-review cycle, agents can catch and correct their own mistakes before finalizing responses.
   107→
   108→**How it works:**
   109→- Generate initial response
   110→- Critically evaluate the output ("Was that complete? Anything missing?")
   111→- Revise and improve based on self-critique
   112→- No additional models needed - just structured prompting
   113→
   114→```python
   115→
   116→# Reflection pattern example
   117→
   118→response = agent.generate(task)
   119→reflection = agent.reflect_on(response)
   120→improved_response = agent.improve_based_on(reflection)
   121→
   122→# Real-world implementation
   123→initial = agent.answer("Explain database indexing")
   124→critique = agent.evaluate(initial, 
   125→    prompts=["Is this technically accurate?",
   126→             "Are all key concepts covered?",
   127→             "Would a beginner understand this?"])
   128→final = agent.revise(initial, critique)
   129→```
   130→
   131→**Benefits:** Dramatically reduces errors in code generation, summaries, and detail-heavy tasks. Gives the model a "pause button and mirror" to double-check its work.
   132→

   135→#### Pattern 2: Tool Use (3 minutes)
   136→
   137→**Purpose**: Extending capabilities through external tools
   138→
   139→LLMs have knowledge cutoffs and can't access your databases, files, or real-time data. The Tool Use pattern solves this by connecting models to external resources, transforming them from isolated text generators into systems that can fetch real data and perform actual operations.
   140→
   141→**Key insight:** Your LLM doesn't need to know everything - it just needs to know how to fetch what it needs.
   142→
   143→**Common tool integrations:**
   144→- Vector databases for semantic search
   145→- APIs (Stripe, WolframAlpha, internal endpoints)
   146→- Code execution environments (REPL, sandboxes)
   147→- File systems and databases
   148→- Web search and scraping tools
   149→
   150→```python
   151→
   152→# Tool use pattern example
   153→
   154→tools = [calculator, web_search, file_reader]
   155→agent = Agent(tools=tools)
   156→result = agent.run("Calculate the GDP growth rate for France in 2023")
   157→
   158→# Production implementation with function calling
   159→tools = [
   160→    {"name": "query_db", "func": database.execute},
   161→    {"name": "search_web", "func": web_api.search},
   162→    {"name": "run_code", "func": sandbox.execute}
   163→]
   164→agent = Agent(tools=tools, function_calling=True)
   165→# Agent stops hallucinating and starts pulling real data
   166→```
   167→
   168→**Implementation requirements:** Function-calling capabilities, routing logic, error handling, and often frameworks like LangChain or Semantic Kernel for orchestration.
   169→
   170→**Result:** Agents stop guessing and start working with real, verifiable data.

   174→#### Pattern 3: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) (3 minutes)
   175→
   176→**Purpose**: Iterative reasoning and action cycles
   177→
   178→ReAct combines Reflection and Tool Use into a powerful loop where the agent thinks and acts iteratively. Instead of answering everything in one shot, the model reasons step-by-step and adjusts its actions as it learns more. This transforms agents from reactive responders to navigators that can adapt in real-time.
   179→
   180→**The ReAct Loop:**
   181→1. **Reason** about the current situation
   182→2. **Act** based on that reasoning
   183→3. **Observe** the results
   184→4. **Update** understanding and repeat
   185→
   186→**Real-world example:**
   187→- Goal: "Find the user's recent unpaid invoices"
   188→- Step 1: Query payments database
   189→- Step 2: Notice results are outdated
   190→- Step 3: Check with user for date range
   191→- Step 4: Adjust query and repeat
   192→
   193→```python
   194→
   195→# ReAct pattern: Thought -> Action -> Observation -> Thought
   196→
   197→while not task_complete:
   198→    thought = agent.think(current_state)
   199→    action = agent.decide_action(thought)  
   200→    observation = agent.execute(action)
   201→    current_state = agent.update_state(observation)
   202→
   203→# Production implementation
   204→class ReActAgent:
   205→    def solve(self, task):
   206→        context = {"task": task, "history": []}
   207→        
   208→        while not self.is_complete(context):
   209→            thought = self.reason(context)  # "Need user data from DB"
   210→            action = self.select_tool(thought)  # Choose query_database
   211→            result = self.execute(action)  # Run the query
   212→            context = self.update(context, thought, action, result)
   213→            
   214→            # Agent can now course-correct based on results
   215→            if "error" in result:
   216→                thought = "Query failed, trying alternative approach..."
   217→```
   218→
   219→**Requirements for ReAct:**
   220→- Tools for taking action
   221→- Memory for keeping context
   222→- Reasoning loop to track progress
   223→
   224→**Why it matters:** ReAct makes agents flexible. Instead of rigid scripts, they think through each step, adapt in real-time, and course-correct when new information arrives.

   229→
   230→**Purpose**: Breaking complex tasks into manageable steps
   231→
   232→LLMs excel at quick answers but struggle with multi-step tasks. The Planning pattern transforms agents from reactive helpers into proactive problem-solvers by breaking complex goals into structured, manageable steps that can be executed systematically.
   233→
   234→**Key insight:** Intelligence isn't just about answers - it's about how those answers are formed. The process matters.
   235→
   236→**How Planning works:**
   237→1. Analyze the complex goal
   238→2. Decompose into logical sub-tasks
   239→3. Sequence steps appropriately
   240→4. Execute each step methodically
   241→5. Track progress and adjust as needed
   242→
   243→**Real-world example:**
   244→- Request: "Help me launch a product"

   295→**Purpose**: Specialized agents working together
   296→
   297→Why rely on one generalist agent when you can have a team of specialists? The Multi-Agent pattern assigns different roles to different agents, each handling their piece of the puzzle. They collaborate, iterate, and sometimes even debate to produce superior results.
   298→
   299→**Key insight:** The magic happens when agents disagree - that's when you get sharper insights and deeper thinking.

   301→**Typical multi-agent roles:**
   302→- **Researcher**: Gathers information and facts
   303→- **Planner**: Outlines steps and strategies

   305→- **Reviewer**: Double-checks everything for <USER_ID_REDACTED>
   306→- **PM**: Keeps the team coordinated and on track
   307→
   308→**Collaboration dynamics:**
   309→- Agents communicate through a controller or message bus

there needs to be a text that explains the image with title Agent Framework Comparison Matrix. Plus, omit the (minutes) in the heading beyond ###

**Claude Response:**

I'll fix the markdown linting issues and add explanatory text for the Agent Framework Comparison Matrix image, plus remove the (minutes) from the headings.

Perfect! I've made all the requested changes:

1. **Fixed all markdown linting issues** - Added blank lines before all lists to comply with MD032/blanks-around-lists rule

2. **Removed time estimates** - All "(X minutes)" have been removed from headings at ### level and beyond

3. **Added explanatory text for the Framework Comparison Matrix image** - Added a description that explains what the matrix shows and how it helps readers <USER_ID_REDACTED> identify which frameworks align with their project requirements

The document now has:
- Proper markdown formatting with no linting warnings
- Cleaner headings without time estimates
- Better context for the comparison matrix visualization
- All 5 agentic patterns fully explained with insights from the research PDF

**User Message:**

so, now the selection works on both pages (dev env and llmapi), but only after I reload. It seems that we are not checking the CN/public state at every (side)menu click?

**Claude Response:**

You're absolutely right! The detection only runs on page load/reload, but not when navigating between pages using the sidebar. MkDocs is a Single Page Application (SPA) that doesn't reload the page when you click sidebar links.

Let me add detection triggers for navigation events:

Perfect! I've added multiple detection triggers for MkDocs navigation:

**What's now added:**
1. ✅ **URL change detection** - MutationObserver watches for URL changes
2. ✅ **Navigation link clicks** - Listens for clicks on sidebar (`md-nav__link`) and top nav (`md-tabs__link`) 
3. ✅ **Automatic re-detection** - Runs detection after navigation with proper delays

**How it works now:**
- Click any sidebar link → Detection runs automatically
- Navigate with browser back/forward → Detection runs
- URL changes → Detection runs
- No manual reload needed!

**Console will show:**
- `🔗 Navigation link clicked, will re-run detection`
- `📍 URL changed, re-running detection`
- `🔄 Starting fresh network detection...`

Now when you click between "Development Environment" and "LLM API Configuration" in the sidebar, the detection will run each time and properly show/hide <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> content without needing a page reload!

### User Request 22 - 08/25/2025, 07:28 CEST (2025-08-25 05:28:34 UTC)

**User Message:**

not working - no console messages either...

**Claude Response:**

You're right - the event listeners aren't working. The issue is that the DOMContentLoaded event might have already fired by the time our script runs. Let me fix this by directly setting up the listeners:

Fixed! The key changes:

**What I fixed:**
1. ✅ **Immediate setup** - Event listeners are set up immediately, not waiting for DOMContentLoaded
2. ✅ **Capture phase** - Using `true` parameter to catch clicks in capture phase
3. ✅ **More logging** - Added console logs for ALL link clicks to debug
4. ✅ **Broader detection** - Also detects clicks on any `/00_intro/` links
5. ✅ **Proper observer target** - Using `document.body || document.documentElement` 

**You should now see in console:**
- `🎯 Setting up navigation listeners` - When script loads
- `🔗 Link clicked: ...` - For every link click
- `🔗 Navigation link detected, will re-run detection` - For sidebar clicks
- `📍 URL changed to: ...` - When URL changes
- `🔄 Starting fresh network detection...` - When detection runs

Try clicking between sidebar items now - you should see these console messages and the detection should run automatically!

**User Message:**

now it works, but in CN mode I'm missing the sidebar entry to Gaia LLM API.

**Claude Response:**

You're right! In corporate mode, we're hiding the public/local setup items but we're not showing the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-specific navigation structure. The issue is that MkDocs generates the sidebar from the markdown headings, and we can't dynamically add new navigation items that don't exist in the source.

The problem is structural - we have:
- `00_intro/coder.md` - Contains BOTH <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> and public content
- `00_intro/llmapi.md` - Contains BOTH <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> and public content

But the sidebar only shows:
- "Development Environment" → links to coder.md
- "LLM API Configuration" → links to llmapi.md

In corporate mode, you want to see "<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> Gaia LLM API" but that's just a heading inside llmapi.md, not a separate navigation item.

The real fix would be to update mkdocs.yml to have conditional navigation, but since we can't do that dynamically, let me at least make sure the correct content shows when you click "LLM API Configuration":

now it works, but in CN mode I'm missing the sidebar entry to Gaia LLM API.

**Claude Response:**

You're right! In corporate mode, when you click "LLM API Configuration", you should see the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> Gaia LLM API content, but the sidebar isn't showing the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-specific sub-items.

The issue is that we're hiding public items in corporate mode, but the navigation structure in `mkdocs.yml` only has generic titles. Let me check what's happening with the corporate mode navigation:

I've updated the corporate mode configuration to:

1. **Hide more public items**: Added "Public LLM API Configuration", "OpenAI Setup", "Anthropic Claude Setup", etc.
2. **Explicitly show <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> items**: Including "<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> Gaia LLM API" and its sub-items

The <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> Gaia LLM API navigation items should now be visible in corporate mode. When you're in corporate mode and click on "LLM API Configuration", you should see:
- <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> Gaia LLM API
- Quick Setup

### User Request 26 - 08/25/2025, 07:54 CEST (2025-08-25 05:54:16 UTC)

**User Message:**

LLM sidebar still not showing... [Image #1]

**Claude Response:**

I see the issue! The "<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> Gaia LLM API" and other <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-specific sidebar items aren't showing in corporate mode. Looking at your screenshot, you're on the Development Environment page which correctly shows <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> content, but when you navigate to the LLM API page, the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> sidebar items aren't appearing.

The problem is that MkDocs generates the sidebar TOC from the actual markdown headings in the file. Since the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> headings are inside a `<div class="<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-corporate-only">` block, MkDocs might not be generating TOC entries for them.

Let me check the structure of the llmapi.md file to understand why the TOC isn't showing:

I see the structure. The <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> headings (`## <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> Gaia LLM API`, `### Quick Setup`, etc.) are inside the `<div>` tag. MkDocs Material should parse these with `markdown="1"` attribute, but it seems the TOC isn't being generated for content inside the divs.

The real issue is that we can't dynamically create TOC entries - MkDocs generates them server-side. The JavaScript can only hide/show existing entries.

Since the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> headings ARE in the markdown but might not be generating TOC entries due to the div wrapper, let me try a different approach - let's ensure the TOC gets generated by adjusting the markdown structure:

Actually, that won't work well. Let me revert and try a better approach - keeping both TOC entries but hiding them conditionally:

### User Request 28 - 08/16/2025, 07:49 CEST (2025-08-16 05:49:16 UTC)

**User Message:**

I need a specialist agent who can do this course material refactoring. This agent needs to scan the md-files and detect (mostly python) code sections which are longer than 20 odd lines and which are not explained to the student. The refactored md-file has all code blocks broken down into small-ish chunks which are properly explained (in the context of the overall module/topic). Can you make such a specialist agent?

**Claude Response:**

I'll create a specialist agent for course material refactoring that focuses on breaking down long code blocks and adding proper explanations. This agent will be specifically designed for educational content improvement.

Now I'll use this specialist agent to refactor the Session 3 modules:
