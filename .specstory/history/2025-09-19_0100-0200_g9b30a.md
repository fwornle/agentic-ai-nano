why is there a nested images i the puml folder of the corporate only section? And what about the other corporate only material (setting-up, etc. coder-detailed.md in 00_intro)? Check the transcript (evening) and re-create this too. Also check how we build the encrypted content and the code that deycrypts this in the published github.io version... re-read the transcript so we don't loose any of these achievements
