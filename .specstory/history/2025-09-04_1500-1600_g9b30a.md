**User Request:** but there is no statusLine visible in this present session (= outside coding) --> debug why not. I believe it's to do with the config being different... or the global config in ~/.claude being used and only fit to serve coding... or the newly created ~/.claude-code including some config which gets into the way? Or was this in ~/Agentic/nano-degree/.claude-code (and this file does not exist in ~/Agentic/coding and, as such, the gobal config is used --> check all of this to see why it isn't configured properly in nano-degree

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json

  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Check global Claude config in ~/.claude",

### Bash - 2025-08-20 04:44:04 UTC [06:44:04 CEST]

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- All sessions are logged locally in the current project's .specstory/history directory
- For multiple sessions, start with most recent and work backwards
- Focus on understanding the project context and previous work completed

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "find .specstory/history -name \"*-session.md\" 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -5",
  "description": "Find latest 5 session log files"
