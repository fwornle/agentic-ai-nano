**User Request:** but there is no statusLine visible in this present session (= outside coding) --> debug why not. I believe it's to do with the config being different... or the global config in ~/.claude being used and only fit to serve coding... or the newly created ~/.claude-code including some config which gets into the way? Or was this in ~/Agentic/nano-degree/.claude-code (and this file does not exist in ~/Agentic/coding and, as such, the gobal config is used --> check all of this to see why it isn't configured properly in nano-degree

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json

  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Check global Claude config in ~/.claude",

### Bash - 2025-08-20 04:44:04 UTC [06:44:04 CEST]

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- All sessions are logged locally in the current project's .specstory/history directory
- For multiple sessions, start with most recent and work backwards
- Focus on understanding the project context and previous work completed

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "find .specstory/history -name \"*-session.md\" 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -5",
  "description": "Find latest 5 session log files"

**User Request:** do we need a separate git repo? I thought we now encrypt stuff and decrypt it while serving it on github.io? Or is it so that one can view it when just checking out the repo... and inside the CN we also get the sub-repo?

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json

**User Message:** I need you to enhance the narrative flow in `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/03_mcp-acp-a2a/Session4_Production_MCP_Deployment.md`.

The course-material-refactorer has already broken down large code blocks and added explanations. Now I need you to:

1. REVIEW the entire file to understand the current narrative flow
2. ADD engaging hooks and transitions between sections to maintain learner engagement
3. ENHANCE section bridges to create better flow from concept to conce...

**Assistant Response:** I'll enhance the narrative flow in the Session 4 file by reading it first, then adding engaging hooks, smooth transitions, and practical context for data engineers while preserving all technical content.
