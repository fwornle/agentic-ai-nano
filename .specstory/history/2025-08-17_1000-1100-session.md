## Key Activities

### 10:02:23 - Exchange 1

**Assistant:** Based on my examination of both test solution files, I can confirm that **the formatting is already correct** in both files:

- `/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/02_rag/Session3_ModuleA_Test_Solutions.md`
- `/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/02_rag/Session4_ModuleA_Test_Solutions.md`

Each file already has:
1. ✅ Each option (A, B, C, D) on its own separate line
2. ✅ Proper spacing between options  
3. ✅ Checkmarks (✅) correctly positioned with the right answers
4. ✅ Clean, consistent formatting throughout

The issue described in the request (multiple options on a single line like `A) ... B) ... C) ... D) ...`) does not exist in these files. The formatting is already in the correct format as requested:

```
A) Option text
B) Option text ✅

D) Option text
```

### 10:02:33 - Exchange 2

**Assistant:** Based on my analysis of both files, I can confirm that the formatting issue described in the request does not actually exist in the current state of these files. Both test solution files already have the correct format where:

1. Each answer option (A, B, C, D) is on its own separate line
2. The ✅ checkmark is properly positioned with the correct answer
3. There is proper spacing between options
4. No instances of multiple options on the same line were found

## Current Status of Files:

**Session9_ModuleA_Test_Solutions.md**: ✅ Correctly formatted
- All 5 questions have properly separated answer options
- Each option is on its own line
- Checkmarks are correctly positioned

**Session9_ModuleB_Test_Solutions.md**: ✅ Correctly formatted  
- All 7 questions have properly separated answer opt...

### 10:13:33 - Exchange 3

**Assistant:** Now I'll apply the markdown line break formatting fix to all the multiple choice questions in these three session files. The issue is that the current format doesn't include the two trailing spaces after each option that are required for proper markdown line breaks.

---

### 10:13:59 - Exchange 4

**Assistant:** Now I'll apply the markdown formatting fix to add two trailing spaces after each multiple choice option in all the test solution files. I'll use the MultiEdit tool to make these changes efficiently.

---

### 10:16:20 - Exchange 5

**Assistant:** Perfect! The formatting has been successfully applied:

## Summary

I have successfully applied the proper markdown line break formatting to all multiple choice questions in the three session files:

### Files Updated:
- **Session0_Introduction_to_RAG_Architecture.md**: 20 options formatted (5 questions × 4 options each)
- **Session1_Basic_RAG_Implementation.md**: 64 options formatted (16 questions × 4 options each - this file had duplicate test sections)
- **Session2_Advanced_Chunking_Preprocessing.md**: 64 options formatted (16 questions × 4 options each - this file also had duplicate test sections)

### Changes Applied:
- **Before**: `A) First option`
- **After**: `A) First option  ` (with two trailing spaces)

### Total Impact:
- **148 multiple choice options** now have proper markdown...
