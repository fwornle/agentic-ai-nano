### Read - 2025-08-29 14:20:50 UTC [16:20:50 CEST]

**User Request:** module 03, session 4 includes large unexplained code blocks. Use the course-material-refactorer to cut them down into sufficiently small (<20 LOC tops) chunks and explain every one of them (what the lines of code do). Then use the enhancer to make sure there is a good narrative through this session

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/03_mcp-acp-a2a/Session4_Production_MCP_Deployment.md",
  "limit": 100
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

### Task - 2025-08-29 14:20:50 UTC [16:20:50 CEST]

**User Request:** module 03, session 4 includes large unexplained code blocks. Use the course-material-refactorer to cut them down into sufficiently small (<20 LOC tops) chunks and explain every one of them (what the lines of code do). Then use the enhancer to make sure there is a good narrative through this session

**Tool:** Task
**Input:** ```json
{
  "description": "Refactor large code blocks in Session 4",
  "prompt": "I need you to refactor the course material in `/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/03_mcp-acp-a2a/Session4_Production_MCP_Deployment.md`.\n\nThis file contains large unexplained code blocks that need to be broken down. Please:\n\n1. SCAN the entire file for code blocks longer than 20 lines\n2. BREAK DOWN each large code block into smaller chunks (maximum 20 lines each)\n3. ADD clear explanations for what each code chunk does - explain the specific lines and their purpose\n4. ENSURE proper code flow - if breaking up a single function/class, maintain logical progression\n5. ADD section transitions between code chunks so the learning flows naturally\n\nFocus specifically on:\n- Breaking down any code blocks > 20 lines\n- Adding detailed line-by-line explanations for complex sections\n- Making sure each code chunk has a clear purpose statement\n- Maintaining the overall structure and learning objectives\n\nThis is educational content for data engineers learning MCP deployment, so make sure explanations are thorough and practical.\n\nIMPORTANT: Actually modify the file on disk - don't just generate explanations.",
