### mcp__archon__health_check - 2025-08-30 01:41:28 UTC [03:41:28 CEST]

**User Request:** let the enhancer review module 01_frameworks and improve it taking into consideration that this course if for data engineers and SW engineers in the context of data engineering (off-board systems - here: tool development for ADAS/automotive function validation via virtual targets in the cloud - resimulation, replay and test fleet as well as customer fleet data analysis, i. e. cloud, scalable data processing + virtual target development for simulation (digital virtual twin to embedded SW for scaled execution in the cloud with large data volumes). Start by finding all (85?) md files in this module, then check their narration style, etc. and potentially improve. If you are using sub agents, make sure they actually write their changes to the files they manipulate (in the past, they often failed to do so)

Focus on making the content immediately relevant for automotive data engineers working on cloud-based ADAS validation systems.\n\n**Project ID**: fbb48347-9635-4b61-a769-ee6ec824adaa"
