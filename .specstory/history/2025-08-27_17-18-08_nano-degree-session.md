# Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- All sessions are logged locally in the current project's .specstory/history directory
- For multiple sessions, start with most recent and work backwards
- Focus on understanding the project context and previous work completed


**Assistant:** *(8/27/2025, 5:06:23 PM)*
I'll read the latest session log to establish continuity with your previous work.

## Session Summary

Based on the session log, you were working on **de-cluttering course material** for an agentic AI nano-degree program. The main activities included:

### Previous Work Completed:
1. **Session 0 & 1**: Successfully de-cluttered, removing verbose content
2. **Session 2-4**: LangChain, LangGraph, and CrewAI sessions were de-cluttered
3. **Session 5**: PydanticAI session was being refactored but got sidetracked with code analysis

### Key Issue Identified:
- The `course-material-refactorer` agent was doing too much (both code refactoring AND content de-cluttering)
- You requested either:
  - Making the agent focus just on de-cluttering, OR  
  - Creating separate agents for different tasks

### Current Status:
- Created a new `content-declutterer` agent focused only on removing verbose LLM-style content
- Sessions 5 & 8 show partial modifications in git
- De-cluttering needs to continue for remaining sessions (6, 7, 9, 10)

### De-cluttering Focus:
Removing "LLM style" verbose content that kills focus:
- Excessive learning outcomes and business justifications
- Time estimates and cognitive load metrics  
- Dashboard tables and learning path complexity
- Verbose preambles before technical content

The goal is concise, technical content that gets straight to the point.

## Exchange 11

**User:** *(8/27/2025, 5:12:05 PM)*
you just created a de-cluttering agent here: '/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.agents/content-declutterer.md'. This agent is not picked up by the /agents command (presumably in the wrong folder... which we only created to have a persistant storage of these agents in this nano-degree repo). You ought to have taken out the de-cluttering elements from the agent definition of the coures-material-refactorer.md file in the same folder. Fix this

**Assistant:** *(8/27/2025, 5:12:10 PM)*
You're absolutely right! I created the de-cluttering agent in the wrong location and should have modified the existing course-material-refactorer instead. Let me fix this:

**User:** *(8/27/2025, 5:15:21 PM)*
[Tool Result]

**Assistant:** *(8/27/2025, 5:15:31 PM)*
Fixed! I've:

1. **Removed de-cluttering responsibilities** from `course-material-refactorer.md` - it now focuses solely on code refactoring (breaking down >20 line blocks) and test creation
2. **Copied `content-declutterer.md`** to the proper Claude agents folder (`~/.claude/agents/`)  
3. **Updated both agents** in the Claude agents folder with the clean separation of concerns

Now you have two distinct agents:
- **`course-material-refactorer`**: Handles code block refactoring and test creation
- **`content-declutterer`**: Removes verbose LLM-style content that kills focus

Both agents are now properly located in `~/.claude/agents/` and should be recognized by the `/agents` command.

Done! The agent has been renamed to `course-material-declutterer` in:
- Both locations (nano-degree/.agents/ and ~/.claude/agents/)
- The agent name field inside the file
- The description references

Now you have two properly named and separated agents:
- **`course-material-refactorer`**: Code refactoring and test creation
- **`course-material-declutterer`**: Removing verbose LLM-style content
