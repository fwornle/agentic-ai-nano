I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, ready to help you with file search and navigation tasks in your codebase.

I understand the critical guidelines:
- Never create parallel versions (v2, v3, enhanced, etc.) - always fix originals
- Always verify results with actual command output before claiming success
- For code analysis: use Serena MCP tools
- For code modifications: use Edit/Write tools
- Follow the project-specific configurations in CLAUDE.md files

I'm currently in `/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree`, which is a git repository on the main branch with a clean working state.

I'm ready to help with:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code/text with regex
- Reading file contents
- Analyzing your codebase structure

What would you like me to help you find or explore in this project?
