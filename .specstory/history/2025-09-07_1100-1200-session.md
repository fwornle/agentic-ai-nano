## Key Activities

### 11:59:48 - Exchange 1

**Assistant:** ## Fixed! ✅

**The status line redirect behavior is now correct:**

**Current Status**: `🛡️ 8.5 🔍EX 🧠 ✅ 📋1130-1230` (no `→coding` indicator)

**Fixed Logic**:
1. **Only shows `→coding` when outside coding project** ✅
2. **Current project (nano-degree) ≠ coding project** ✅  
3. **Last prompt was non-coding ("how many modules")** ✅
4. **Result: No redirect indicator** ✅

**Behavior now**:
- **In nano-degree + coding prompt**: Shows `→coding`
- **In nano-degree + non-coding prompt**: No `→coding` (current state)
- **In coding project**: Never shows `→coding` (already there)

The redirect indicator will now appear and disappear correctly based on whether each individual prompt involves coding activity, exactly as you requested.
