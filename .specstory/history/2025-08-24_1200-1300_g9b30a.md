### Text Exchange - 2025-08-24 10:55:38 UTC [12:55:38 CEST]

**User Message:** This failed to produce the desired (and promised) results: both in public and CN mode, the side bar shows BMW content, Coder, ...: [Image #1] (from public mode... it's identical in CN) and the BMW specific sidebar elements don't work (nothing happens) --> seems defunct
