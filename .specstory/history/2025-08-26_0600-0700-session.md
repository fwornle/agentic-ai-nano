## Key Activities

### 06:56:13 - Exchange 1

**User:** session0_Intro introduces the 5 coding patterns, but other than a sequence diagram it does not explain what those coding patterns are. Research this article to gain insights: '/Users/q284340/Documents/coding-patterns.pdf'

**Assistant:** I'll read the PDF document to understand the coding patterns and help enhance the Session 0 introduction with proper explanations.

### 06:56:23 - Exchange 2

**Assistant:** I'll now examine the current Session 0 introduction file to see what needs to be enhanced with the detailed explanations of the 5 agentic patterns from the PDF.
