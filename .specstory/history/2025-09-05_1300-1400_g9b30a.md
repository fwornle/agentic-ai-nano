## Key Activities

### TodoWrite - 2025-08-27 20:19:27 UTC [22:19:27 CEST]

**User Request:** Transform the de-cluttered Session 1 file at `docs-content/03_mcp-acp-a2a/Session1_Basic_MCP_Server.md` into an engaging learning experience.

Add compelling narrative elements:
1. Opening hook about building your first MCP server
2. Problem/solution story for why we're building a weather server
3. Code context that explains the significance of each implementation step
4. Progressive narrative showing how each piece builds on the previous
5. Inspiring conclusion about what this first server enables

Preserve ALL technical content, code examples, tests, and practical exercises exactly as they are. Focus on adding engaging introductions, transitions, and context around the existing technical material.

**User Message:** a lot of the links in the images overview document appear to be broken (thumbnails not showing). Try to propose a matching image from the corresponding images folder (in the same module). For each module, also list the images which are not referenced in any of the md-files. In addition, Session 2 appears to have 3 main documents with Langchain seemingly being the main document. How are the other two documents integrated in the course? should they be further optional modules for the implementor p...

**User Message:** I need you to analyze the nano-degree course structure and identify issues with the image reference guide. Here's what I've discovered:

## Current Issues Found:

### 1. Broken Image References in Current Guide
Many image references in my current guide use paths that don't exist. For example:
- I reference `images/agent-frameworks-overview.png` but actual file is `agent-core-components.png`

**User Message:** but in the github repo (not the published version on github.io), I still seem to have the viewable png's, md's ... in parallel to content.encrypted.json - how can I hide this outside the CN? Will we maybe need the sub-repo for this after all? [Image #1]

**Assistant Response:** You're absolutely right! The issue you've identified is crucial:

## 🚨 Current Problem

Looking at your screenshot, I can see that in the **GitHub repository itself** (not GitHub Pages), the corporate files are **still visible in plain text**:

- `cn-cluster.png` - viewable image ✅ visible in repo
- `coder-detailed.md` - readable markdown ✅ visible in repo  
- `Session10_Enterprise_Integration_Production_Deployment.md` - full BMW content ✅ visible in repo
- Plus all the BMW PlantUML files and i...
