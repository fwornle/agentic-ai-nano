# Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- All sessions are logged locally in the current project's .specstory/history directory
- For multiple sessions, start with most recent and work backwards
- Focus on understanding the project context and previous work completed


**Assistant:** *(8/16/2025, 1:27:34 PM)*
I'll read the latest session log to establish continuity for our work.

Based on the session log, I can see the previous work context:

## Session Continuity Summary

**Previous Work Context:**
- Working on improving course materials in the nano-degree project
- Systematically refactoring Sessions 0-2 by breaking up long code blocks (>20 lines) and adding explanations
- Creating multiple-choice tests with separate solution files for each session/module
- The last session was working on Session 8 Module B refactoring

**Key Achievements:**
- Created a specialized "Course Material Refactorer Agent" with comprehensive guidelines
- Enhanced the agent to ensure no code blocks exceed 20 lines without explanation
- Added requirements for mandatory multiple-choice tests and solution files
- Included strict markdown validation and linting requirements

**Current State:**
- Session logs show work was interrupted due to VSCode crash
- The Course Material Refactorer Agent was successfully created and enhanced
- Ready to continue with Session 8 Module B refactoring using the specialized agent approach

**Next Steps:**
Continue with Session 8 Module B refactoring, applying the systematic approach of breaking down long code blocks, adding educational explanations, ensuring proper markdown formatting, and creating comprehensive tests with solutions.

file ~/.claude/agents/course-material-refactorer.md is not picked up (registered) as sub-agent. Comparing it's format, it looks different from other agents in this folder, say code-refactoring-specialist.md --> compare the two and ensure that the course-material-refactorer.md is structured in a way that makes claude code recognize it as sub agent

**Assistant:** *(8/16/2025, 1:31:10 PM)*
I'll compare the course-material-refactorer.md with an existing recognized agent to fix the formatting issue.

**Assistant:** *(8/16/2025, 1:31:20 PM)*
I can see the issue! The course-material-refactorer.md is missing the YAML frontmatter that Claude Code requires to recognize it as an agent. Let me fix this by adding the proper frontmatter structure.

**Assistant:** *(8/16/2025, 1:31:34 PM)*
Perfect! The course-material-refactorer agent is now properly formatted with the required YAML frontmatter structure that matches the existing agents. It should now be recognized by Claude Code as a specialized agent.

The key changes made:
1. **Added YAML frontmatter** with `---` delimiters
2. **Added `name`** field matching the filename
3. **Added `description`** field with usage examples in the same format as other agents
4. **Maintained all the detailed specifications** for course material refactoring

The agent is now ready to be used for refactoring Session 8 Module B and other course materials.
