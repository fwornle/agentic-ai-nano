## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-24 15:05:44 UTC [17:05:44 CEST]

**User Message:** why do you still test for 10.xx.yy.zz? (üîç Trying internal service: https://10.21.202.14/favicon.ico). Told you that this introduces a latency we don't want when detecting "public" - remove this!

**User Message:** you weren't listening. The sidebar content does not fit the page - you are displaying a number of sidebar entries which have nothing to do with the page: [Image #1] - fix this and ENSURE that sidebar and page are ALWAYS in sync

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-24 15:20:33 UTC [17:20:33 CEST]

**User Message:** now you show both sets of sidebar contents (CN and page) - is it so complicated to NOT show the CN sidebar entries when we're public?!

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-24 15:29:41 UTC [17:29:41 CEST]

**User Message:** sigh - you're useless!! What can you do differently? We've been trying to solve this EXTREMLY SIMPLE problem for hours now!!

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-24 15:43:24 UTC [17:43:24 CEST]

**User Message:** after a hard re-load of home, I get this: [Image #1] - missing "Getting Started" (as they appear to have been declared "BMW only"?! üö´ Hidden BMW nav item: üöÄ Getting Started
network-detection.js:248 üö´ Hidden BMW nav item: Getting Started)\
