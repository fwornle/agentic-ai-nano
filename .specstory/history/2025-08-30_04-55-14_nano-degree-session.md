# Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- All sessions are logged locally in the current project's .specstory/history directory
- For multiple sessions, start with most recent and work backwards
- Focus on understanding the project context and previous work completed

Based on the session log, I can see that in the most recent session, you worked extensively on enhancing the 01_frameworks module for automotive ADAS data engineering. Here's a summary of the continuity:

## Previous Session Summary

**Objective**: Transform the generic AI agent framework course content to be specifically tailored for automotive ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) data engineering professionals.

**Progress Made**:
- **11 files enhanced** with automotive ADAS context (up from initial 5)
- Successfully transformed generic AI examples to real-world ADAS scenarios
- Added automotive-specific technical references (Tesla FSD, Waymo validation, Mercedes-Benz systems)
- Integrated safety-critical elements (ISO 26262, regulatory compliance)
- Enhanced with sensor fusion contexts (LiDAR, 8-camera systems, 36Hz processing)

**Key Files Enhanced**:
1. `Session1_ModuleD_Coding_Assistant_Case_Study.md` ⭐ (User highlighted)
2. `Session0_ModuleA_Historical_Context_Evolution.md`
3. `Session0_ModuleB_Advanced_Pattern_Theory.md`
4. `Session1_ModuleA_Advanced_Agent_Patterns.md`
5. `Session2_ModuleA_Advanced_LangChain_Patterns.md`
6. Plus 6 additional core files

**Status at Session End**:
- Working tree was clean (all changes committed)
- Minor markdown linting issues identified in 2 files
- **Remaining scope**: 85+ total files in the module, with many still needing ADAS enhancement

**Context for Continuity**:
- Project ID: `fbb48347-9635-4b61-a769-ee6ec824adaa` (Archon was having connectivity issues)
- Focus: Off-board cloud systems, scalable data processing, digital twins, virtual target development
- Target audience: Data engineers and SW engineers in automotive ADAS

The session ended mid-task while fixing markdown linting issues, with significant progress made but substantial work remaining to complete the full module enhancement.

## Session Continuity Summary

**Previous Session (Aug 30, 03:34 AM)**: Course Material Enhancement for Automotive ADAS Data Engineering

### Key Context:
- **Objective**: Transform 01_frameworks module from generic AI agent course to automotive ADAS data engineering specialization
- **Target Audience**: Data engineers & SW engineers working on automotive ADAS off-board cloud systems
- **Focus Areas**: Cloud scalable data processing, virtual target development, digital twin simulation
- **Project ID**: `fbb48347-9635-4b61-a769-ee6ec824adaa`

### Progress Made:
- **11 files enhanced** with automotive ADAS context (up from initial 5)
- Successfully transformed key module files with domain-specific examples
- Added real-world automotive references (Tesla FSD, Waymo validation, Mercedes systems)
- Integrated safety-critical elements (ISO 26262, regulatory compliance)
- Enhanced with sensor system contexts (LiDAR, 8-camera processing at 36Hz)

### Files Enhanced:
1. `Session1_ModuleD_Coding_Assistant_Case_Study.md` ⭐ (User highlighted priority)
2. `Session0_ModuleA_Historical_Context_Evolution.md`
3. `Session0_ModuleB_Advanced_Pattern_Theory.md`
4. `Session1_ModuleA_Advanced_Agent_Patterns.md`
5. `Session2_ModuleA_Advanced_LangChain_Patterns.md`
6. Plus 6 additional core curriculum files

### Current Status:
- **Working tree clean** (all changes committed)
- **Minor issue**: 2 files had markdown linting errors that were being fixed when session ended
- **Remaining scope**: 74+ files still need ADAS enhancement (85+ total files in module)
- Session ended mid-task while fixing formatting issues

### Next Steps Needed:
Continue systematic enhancement of remaining Session 1-5 module files with the same ADAS transformation approach, focusing on sensor fusion, safety validation, and cloud-scale automotive data processing contexts.

You were just in the process of enhancing module 01_frameworks when VSCode crashed... and Claude with it. Resume the task I gave you. Check the latest commit to see which files already have been modified. This was the task I gave to you:
let the enhancer sub-agent review module 01_frameworks and improve it taking into consideration that this course if for data and SW engineers in the context of data engineering (off-board systems - here: tool development for cloud-based, scalable data processing (petabyte region) and re-simulation of SW functions with recorded real-world data). Just focus on a coherent narrative and TECHNICAL focus of the module (data engineering - some of the examples you used before are too far fetched and not sufficiently close to what's relevant to our SW engineers in their daily work... this needs improved). To be clear, I don't want you to rewrite the content of the modules, just enhance the narrative thereby only IMPROVING the already refined chapters. Use parallel execution of the enhancer sub-agent to work on the 84 or so files in this module. Note - you don't need to modify the Test_Solutions files unless you have changed a question / the multiple-choice answers in the corresponding main module).

I'll resume the task of enhancing module 01_frameworks for data engineering professionals. Let me first check which files have already been modified and then continue with the remaining files using parallel execution.[Tool: mcp__archon__health_check]
