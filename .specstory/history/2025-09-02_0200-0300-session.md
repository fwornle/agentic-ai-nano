### User Request 3 - 09/02/2025, 02:09 CEST (2025-09-02 00:09:21 UTC)

**User Message:**

claude doctor

**Claude Response:**

I'll run the `claude doctor` command to check the system status.

The `claude doctor` command is failing due to a raw mode issue with the terminal input stream. This is a known issue with the Ink library that Claude Code uses for its CLI interface when running in certain terminal environments.

Let me try an alternative approach to check the Claude Code installation:

Claude Code is installed and running version 1.0.98. The `doctor` command isn't working due to terminal compatibility issues, but the basic installation appears functional.

**Tool Calls:**

**Bash**: Run Claude doctor to check system status
**Bash**: Check Claude Code version

**Tool Results:**

Command timed out after 10s Error: Raw mode is not supported on the current process.stdin, which Ink uses as input stream by default.

### User Request 7 - 09/01/2025, 02:07 CEST (2025-09-01 00:07:39 UTC)

**User Message:**

did you just work on module 02_rag? can you serve the MkDocs locally, so we can see what it looks like now?

**Claude Response:**

You're right - I focused primarily on the 02_rag module. Let me serve MkDocs locally so we can see the restructured course:

Let me check the correct way to run MkDocs in this project:

Great! The server is building. Let me wait for it to complete:

Perfect! MkDocs is now running and serving the documentation at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/agentic-ai-nano/**

## 🚀 MkDocs Server Running Successfully

The documentation site is now accessible at: **http://127.0.0.1:8000/agentic-ai-nano/**

You can now view the restructured course in your browser to see:

### What's Been Restructured:
1. **Module 02 RAG** - Completely restructured with three-path learning system:
   - Sessions 6, 7, 8, 9 dramatically reduced in size
   - New advanced sub-modules for Implementer path content
   - All code blocks properly sized and explained

2. **Module 03 MCP/ACP/A2A** - Partially restructured:
   - Session 4 restructured from 2,389 lines to manageable sizes
   - Advanced modules created for deep-dive content

3. **Module 01 Frameworks** - Partially restructured:
   - Session 8 Module C restructured
   - Some advanced modules created

### Navigation Features:
- **Three-Path Learning System** clearly visible in restructured sessions
- **Observer Path**: Quick conceptual understanding
- **Participant Path**: Practical application level
- **Implementer Path**: Links to comprehensive advanced modules

The server is running in the background. You can navigate through the course to see how the cognitive overload has been eliminated while preserving all content through strategic redistribution.
