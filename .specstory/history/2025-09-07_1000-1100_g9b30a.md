## Key Activities

### Bash - 2025-09-12 07:40:13 UTC [09:40:13 CEST]

**User Request:** this is silly - if it worked, there would be a 0930-1030 file in coding. There is no such file. So, the live logging system did not capture the transcripts entries from nano-degree, classified them as coding and stored them in the target format in the LSL file in coding. It also did not store any of the "2MB and growing" content of today in any file. So how can you declare this as "working"? It is the opposite of working

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-12* && ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-12*",
  "description": "Check for ALL today's session files in both projects"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

### TodoWrite - 2025-08-30 01:56:19 UTC [03:56:19 CEST]

**User Request:** let the enhancer review module 01_frameworks and improve it taking into consideration that this course if for data and SW engineers in the context of data engineering (off-board systems - here: tool development for cloud-based, scalable data processing (petabyte region) + simulation and re-simulation of recoreded vehicle data (automotive). Start by finding all (85?) md files in this module, then check their narration style, etc. and potentially improve. If you are using parallel sub agents, make sure they actually write their changes to the files they manipulate (in the past, they often failed to do so). Make sure you don't hallucinate any stories which sound plausible but aren't researched... especially not when making up automotive examples - the target audience are specialists in that area and will notice any made-up content. Keep it technical in the key technologies in this type of data engineering

**Tool:** TodoWrite
