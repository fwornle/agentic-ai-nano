## Key Activities

### Bash - 2025-09-12 07:40:13 UTC [09:40:13 CEST]

**User Request:** this is silly - if it worked, there would be a 0930-1030 file in coding. There is no such file. So, the live logging system did not capture the transcripts entries from nano-degree, classified them as coding and stored them in the target format in the LSL file in coding. It also did not store any of the "2MB and growing" content of today in any file. So how can you declare this as "working"? It is the opposite of working

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-09-12* && ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-12*",
  "description": "Check for ALL today's session files in both projects"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
