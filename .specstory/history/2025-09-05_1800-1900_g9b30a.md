### mcp__constraint-monitor__update_constraints - 2025-09-05 16:23:37 UTC [18:23:37 CEST]

**User Request:** before we investigate the guardrail issue - add the key fixes you had to apply to the puml guardrail, so that we don't have to fix this everytime, but you can avoid these issues rightaway, going forward

**Input:** ```json

### TodoWrite - 2025-09-05 16:35:30 UTC [18:35:30 CEST]

**User Request:** now clean up test scripts you created along the way and that are no longer needed in coding and check once more, if all prompts from the last 3h are in the LSL files where they belong (probably not the case for the last 2h or so, where the system wasn't redirecting correctly). Then update the docs with the latest changes we just made in the logic of the guardrails. Maybe add a state-chart for how the state of the LSL/traj system changes, and a flow chart of the decisions that are taken along the ways of redirecting

**Input:** ```json
