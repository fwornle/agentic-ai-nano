## Key Activities

### TodoWrite - 2025-08-27 20:21:28 UTC [22:21:28 CEST]

**User Request:** Transform the de-cluttered Session 2 file at `docs-content/03_mcp-acp-a2a/Session2_FileSystem_MCP_Server.md` into an engaging learning experience.

Add compelling narrative elements:
1. Opening hook about giving AI the power to understand and navigate file systems
2. Problem/solution story about why filesystem access matters for AI systems
3. Code context explaining the significance of safe file operations and security boundaries
4. Progressive narrative showing how we build from simple reads to complex operations
5. Inspiring conclusion about the possibilities this unlocks

Preserve ALL technical content, code examples, tests, and practical exercises exactly as they are. Focus on adding engaging introductions, transitions, and context around the existing technical material.

**User Message:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

**User Message:** our latest session got interrupted (I accidentally pressed CTRL+Z and you went into some weird background/suspend mode. Tried the suggested "fg" go get you back, but it didn't do anything. The second CTLR+Z then killed Claude... presumably without fully updating our session logs (LSL). You were in the middle of fixing sessions 9-10 (everything up to 8 already got fixed). You also changed the links in sessions 1-8 (or all of them in module 01_frameworks?) to github links, but you made a blunder o...

**User Message:** now, analyse the entire degree and find all references to screenshots. Screenshots are those which do not have a corresponding puml file and, as such have been lifted off some publication on the internet. Make a json file with this info & add the following meta info: caption (if any) and surrounding context (so we know what the screenshot is supposed to be about). The issue is that you have added these screenshots in a best effort manner, presumably using the filename as only source of info of w...

**User Message:** the puml/png for agent-core-components is more confusing than the screenshot - keep the screenshot. Can you find this on the internet to find some context?

**User Message:** but in the github repo (not the published version on github.io), I still seem to have the viewable png's, md's ... in parallel to content.encrypted.json - how can I hide this outside the CN? Will we maybe need the sub-repo for this after all? [Image #1]

**Assistant Response:** You're absolutely right! The issue you've identified is crucial:

## ðŸš¨ Current Problem

Looking at your screenshot, I can see that in the **GitHub repository itself** (not GitHub Pages), the corporate files are **still visible in plain text**:

- `cn-cluster.png` - viewable image âœ… visible in repo
- `coder-detailed.md` - readable markdown âœ… visible in repo  
- `Session10_Enterprise_Integration_Production_Deployment.md` - full BMW content âœ… visible in repo
- Plus all the BMW PlantUML files and i...
