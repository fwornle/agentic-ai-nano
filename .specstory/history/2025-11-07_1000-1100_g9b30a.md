### User

Warmup

### Assistant

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I'm currently in the `/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree` directory, which is a git repository on the main branch.

I can efficiently search and explore this codebase using:
- **Glob patterns** for broad file matching
- **Grep/regex** for searching file contents
- **Read** for analyzing specific files
- **Bash** for file operations

I understand the critical guidelines:
- No parallel versions (v2, v3, enhanced, etc.)
- Always verify results before claiming success
- Use standard tools for code modifications
- Follow the project's CLAUDE.md standards

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
