**User:** it seems that you wrote all the nano-degree related chat history to the .specstory/history files in project coding - check and move those entries to project nano-degree (should be everything from the last 3-4 days, I think... check. Then reflect why the coding session logs got detected as coding instead of nano-degree... and fix this.

**Assistant:** I'll check the session logs and move the nano-degree related content to the correct project directory.
