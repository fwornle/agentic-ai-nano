**User Request:** shouldn't the "LSL generation script" use the "enhanced transcript monitor" code? I don't want parallel functionality!! Make sure that what I use during live classification / live session logging is the same code as is used when running this in batch mode to retroactively turn an entire set of historic transcript files into classified LSL files

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "CODING_TARGET_PROJECT=\"/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree\" node /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/scripts/generate-proper-lsl-from-transcripts.js 2>&1 | head -15",
  "description": "Test the corrected integration"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
