## Key Activities

### 15:35:13 - Exchange 1

**Assistant:** I can see there's a current session `2025-09-06_1430-1530_coding-session-from-nano-degree.md` that was last modified at 15:11. The status line should be showing this current session, not the old ended one. The problem is the status line logic is looking for the wrong file pattern in nano-degree.

---

### 15:36:27 - Exchange 2

**Assistant:** Perfect! Now it shows `ðŸ”´1430-1530(ended)` which is correct. The 1430-1530 session has ended and there's no new session yet. The status line is now working properly - it shows the most recent session was 1430-1530 and it has ended.
