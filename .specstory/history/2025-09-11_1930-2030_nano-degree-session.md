.. we then need 2x CTRL-C to get back to the shell's prompt

Looking at the coding script shutdown hang after "üìù Created local project file". Let me check the simplified session logger script that seems to be causing the hang:

**Assistant:** *(9/11/2025, 7:16:11 PM)*
The issue is likely that the script completes successfully (line 74: "Session logged with timestamp") but doesn't properly exit, causing the hang. The script creates the file at line 90 and logs success at line 71, but then the process doesn't terminate cleanly.

Let me check what happens after main() completes:

**Assistant:** *(9/11/2025, 7:16:18 PM)*
The issue is that `simplified-session-logger.js` doesn't explicitly call `process.exit()` after completing its work. Most other scripts in the codebase do call `process.exit(0)` to ensure clean termination. Let me add this:

**Assistant:** *(9/11/2025, 7:17:06 PM)*
Fixed! The issue was that `simplified-session-logger.js` wasn't explicitly calling `process.exit()` after completing its work, causing the process to hang. The script now properly exits with code 0 on success or code 1 on error, following the pattern used by other scripts in the codebase.

The change ensures that after creating the session log file, the script terminates cleanly instead of hanging and requiring manual CTRL-C interruption.
