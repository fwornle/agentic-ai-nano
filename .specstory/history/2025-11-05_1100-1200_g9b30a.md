Warmup

### Assistant

I'm ready to help you with your search requests. I'm Claude Code, a file search specialist for the nano-degree project at `/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree`.

I can help you:
- **Find files** using glob patterns
- **Search code** using regex patterns
- **Read file contents** when you know specific paths
- **Explore the codebase** structure and navigate efficiently

The repository is currently on the main branch (clean status). I understand the critical rules from your CLAUDE.md:
- No parallel versions (v2, v3, enhanced, etc.)
- Always verify results before claiming success
- Use standard tools for code modifications, not Serena MCP

What would you like me to search for or explore in this project?
