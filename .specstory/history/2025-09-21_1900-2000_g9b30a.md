### Text Exchange - 2025-09-21 17:27:46 UTC [19:27:46 CEST]

**User Message:** [Image #1] - despite being in CN and CN mode had been detected, when I click the session 10 sidemenu item, I get to the non-CN version (public). And we still don't have sidemenus in CN mode on CN pages.

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
