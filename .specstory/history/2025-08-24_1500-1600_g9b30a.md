**User Message:** Nothing changed. Besides the bullet point formatting, what exactly did you fix? I don't think you truly know what's going on. I suspect, it doesn't even work locally, so pushing it to the remote won't fix anything!! Issue 1: Getting started has no sidebar - it seems that you hide it? why? [Image #1]. Issue 2: The settings & env page is still a 404 - look at the error messages on the console. Should be easy to understand the RC from there and fix it... [Image #2]. Should we debug this?

**User Message:** sidebar seems fixed and the settings shown as "local set-up" (which is correct when not logged into the CN). However, when inside the CN, we should get our coder page as well as the Gaia LLM API. This is not the case. Display the status of public/corporate in the top or bottom bar (wherever it's more suitable). Then ensure that you use this status when displaying the settings & env page

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the technical details and user feedback:

1. **Initial Phase - Network Detection Issues**: The user reported that the Getting Started page has no sidebar and Setup & Environment gives 404 errors, even though I claimed to have fixed these issues. They showed screenshots proving the issues persist.

2. ...
