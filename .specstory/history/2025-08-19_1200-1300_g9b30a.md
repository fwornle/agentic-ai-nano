## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-19 10:00:29 UTC [12:00:29 CEST]

**User Message:** session 8 seems to have two tests - the first one can probably be removed? Check and fix. Also, check the formatting of all Test_Solution files - we always want all answers with the correct one ticked off - see for ex. Session8_Test_Solution. Also, you still seem to have failed to end the lines with two blanks here and there... so the first answer is still inline with the question. Check and fix

Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation started as a continuation from a previous session about restructuring a nano-degree course. The user had previously asked me to systematically review and fix ALL sessions in Module 03 to consolidate test/solution structures.
