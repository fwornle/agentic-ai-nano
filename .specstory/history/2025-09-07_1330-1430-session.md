**Request:** so, you produced a number of puml/png files with errors. It seems, though, that you fixed them, but you kept both versions (broken and fixed one, often with -simple or -flow suffix). Clean up this mess (both puml and png). Also, are we still using the background "demon"? Check which of the js files in the current git change set are needed and remove everything that's obsolete
