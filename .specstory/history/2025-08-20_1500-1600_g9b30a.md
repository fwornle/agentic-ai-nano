**User Request:** Add an md-file "coder.md" describing the set-up of our cloud infrastructure (https://coder.com/). Explain the idea of developing in the cloud, via dev-containers in VSCode (or similar IDEs - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) and how this will facilitate the completion of the nano-degree, as the participants will be up and running without the habitual pains of tool installations and integrations within a corporate network. Use all the images provided in 00_intro/images. Store the generated coder.md in 00_intro. Research dev-containers and coder from the provided links (and the documentation found on those sites - summarize briefly... it should be informative but brief.

**Tool:** WebFetch
**Input:** ```json

  "content": "# Cloud Development Environment with Coder\n\n## Overview: Developing in the Cloud\n\nThe Agentic AI Nano-Degree leverages **Coder**, a cloud development environment platform, to provide instant, consistent, and secure development workspaces. This eliminates the traditional friction of local environment setup, dependency conflicts, and corporate network restrictions that often delay or derail learning initiatives.\n\n![Coder Architecture](images/coder-architecture.png)\n*Figure 1: Coder's architecture enables secure, scalable cloud development environments accessible from any browser or IDE*\n\n## Why Cloud Development?\n\n### Traditional Challenges in Corporate Environments\n\nCorporate developers and learners typically face:\n- **Tool Installation Restrictions**: IT policies blocking software installations\n- **Network Limitations**: Firewalls preventing package downloads\n- **Version Conflicts**: Incompatible Python versions, library dependencies\n- **Platform Inconsistencies**: Windows vs Mac vs Linux differences\n- **Resource Constraints**: Limited local computing power for AI workloads\n\n### The Cloud Development Solution\n\nCloud development environments solve these challenges by:\n- **Pre-configured Environments**: All tools, dependencies, and configurations ready-to-use\n- **Browser-Based Access**: Work from any device with internet access\n- **Consistent Experience**: Identical environment for all participants\n- **Scalable Resources**: Cloud computing power for intensive AI/ML workloads\n- **Zero Local Installation**: No conflicts with corporate IT policies\n\n## How Coder Works\n\n![Coder Workspaces](images/coder-workspaces.png)\n*Figure 2: Coder workspace dashboard showing available development environments*\n\nCoder provides self-hosted development environments that can be:\n1. **Deployed** on your infrastructure (cloud, on-premises, or air-gapped)\n2. **Configured** using Terraform templates for consistency\n3. **Provisioned** instantly by developers or AI coding agents\n4. **Accessed** through browsers, VS Code, or other IDEs\n\n### Workspace Lifecycle\n\n![Coder New Workspace](images/coder-new-workspace.png)\n*Figure 3: Creating a new workspace with pre-configured templates*\n\n1. **Select Template**: Choose from pre-configured nano-degree environments\n2. **Configure Resources**: Adjust CPU, memory, and GPU as needed\n3. **Launch Workspace**: Environment provisions in seconds\n4. **Start Developing**: All tools and dependencies ready immediately\n\n![Coder Workspace Configuration](images/coder-new-workspace-config.png)\n*Figure 4: Workspace configuration options for resource allocation*\n\n## Dev Containers: The Foundation\n\n![VS Code Dev Container](images/vscode-dev-container.png)\n*Figure 5: VS Code seamlessly connecting to a dev container environment*\n\nDev containers provide:\n- **Containerized Environments**: Isolated, reproducible development spaces\n- **Full IDE Integration**: Complete IntelliSense, debugging, and extensions\n- **Configuration as Code**: `devcontainer.json` defines entire environment\n- **Portable Settings**: Personal preferences follow you across workspaces\n\n### Key Benefits for Nano-Degree Participants\n\n1. **Instant Setup**: No installation required - start coding immediately\n2. **Consistent Environment**: Everyone uses identical configurations\n3. **Pre-installed Tools**: Python, frameworks, libraries all ready\n4. **GPU Access**: Cloud GPUs for AI model training and inference\n5. **Collaboration Ready**: Share workspaces for pair programming or assistance\n\n## Nano-Degree Specific Setup\n\n![Coder Workspace Running](images/coder-workspace.png)\n*Figure 6: Active Coder workspace with nano-degree environment*\n\n### Pre-configured Environments\n\nEach module comes with specialized workspaces:\n\n**Module 1 - Agent Frameworks**\n- Python 3.11+\n- LangChain, CrewAI, PydanticAI pre-installed\n- API keys securely managed\n- Sample data and examples loaded\n\n**Module 2 - RAG Architecture**\n- Vector databases (Chroma, Pinecone clients)\n- Embedding models cached\n- Document processing tools\n- Performance monitoring dashboards\n\n**Module 3 - MCP/ACP/A2A**\n- Protocol servers configured\n- Network tools for testing\n- Security certificates installed\n- Multi-agent simulation environments\n\n### Cluster Resources\n\n![Coder Cluster](images/cn-cluster.png)\n*Figure 7: Coder cluster providing scalable compute resources*\n\nThe nano-degree infrastructure provides:\n- **Elastic Scaling**: Resources adjust to demand\n- **GPU Availability**: For training and inference workloads\n- **Persistent Storage**: Your work is saved between sessions\n- **Network Isolation**: Secure, private development spaces\n\n## Working with AI Assistants\n\n![Coder LLM Integration](images/coder-llm.png)\n*Figure 8: Coder environments support AI coding assistants*\n\nCoder workspaces integrate with:\n- **Claude**: Anthropic's AI assistant\n- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion and generation\n- **OpenAI GPT**: Custom agent development\n- **Local LLMs**: Private, secure AI assistance\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Step 1: Access Your Workspace\n\n1.
