### Text Exchange - 2025-09-19 10:28:44 UTC [12:28:44 CEST]

**User Message:** this link is still there (public mode): [Image #1] - leads to 404. And in CN mode, the images still don't show + the URL seems to be pointing to the encrypted file ([Image #2]) but even clicking it, does not bring the image to light. Clicking the non-encrypted links (eg. Coder Architecture) brings up the correct image from the regular part of the repo. However, this should be embedded images, not links - presumably a format issue in the underlying coder-details.md

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
