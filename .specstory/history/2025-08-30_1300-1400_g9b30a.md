### Text Exchange - 2025-08-30 11:34:36 UTC [13:34:36 CEST]

**User Message:** we use Argo Workflows instead of Airflow. Scan all md-files in 01_frameworks and replace

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-30 11:43:40 UTC [13:43:40 CEST]

**User Message:** review the course-material-refactorer.md and clean-up it's responsibilities. It's main job is to break down large unexplained code blocks into smaller chunks, each one followed by a clear and sufficiently detailed explanation what the lines in the  code does

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-30 11:48:31 UTC [13:48:31 CEST]

**User Message:** review the course-material-refactorer.md and clean-up it's responsibilities. It's main job is to break down large unexplained code blocks into smaller chunks, each one followed by a clear and sufficiently detailed explanation what the lines in the code do in this context and, where appropriate, what is special and how they help achieving what the section sets out to do. The explanation should make it easy for the student to follow along with the content and learn how it works. Cutting down large...

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-30 11:56:02 UTC [13:56:02 CEST]

**User Message:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions
