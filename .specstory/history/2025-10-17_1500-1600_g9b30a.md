### User

slash command "/sl" ALWAYS asks for permission to run this:\
│ Bash command                                                                                                     │
│                                                                                                                  │
│   basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"    \
... can this be approved automatically?

### Assistant

Yes, these commands can be auto-approved. They're all read-only operations:

1. `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"` - Gets project name
2. `ls -t <path>/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1` - Lists session log files

These are safe, non-destructive commands that the `/sl` slash command needs every time it runs.

**To auto-approve these:**

You can add them to your Claude Code configuration. Based on the tool usage policy in my instructions, there's an allow-list for commands. You'd want to add:

```
Bash(basename:*)
Bash(git rev-parse:*)
```

However, the specific configuration location depends on your Claude Code setup. You can:

1. **Check for a hooks configuration file** in `~/.claude-code/` or similar
2. **Look for settings/preferences** in Claude Code where you can whitelist bash commands
3. **Create a user prompt submit hook** that auto-approves these specific read-only patterns

Would you like me to help you locate and modify the configuration file to add these auto-approvals?
