**User Message:** 
  When running from nano-degree with --mode=foreign, we want to find coding-related exchanges FROM nano-degree that should
  be redirected TO the coding project. So the logic should be:

  - If running from nano-degree, mark exchanges as redirected if they touch coding
  - If running from coding, mark exchanges as redirected if they're from nano-degree AND touch coding\


**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
