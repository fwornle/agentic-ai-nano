## Key Activities

### 10:21:07 - Exchange 1

**Assistant:** OH NO! This confirms the problem:

**Original Test Question (Session1_Bare_Metal_Agents.md):**
- A) Better performance  
- **B) Deeper understanding of agent mechanics** ← **ORIGINAL CORRECT ANSWER**
- C) Easier deployment  
- D) Lower resource usage  

**Randomized Test Solution (Session1_Test_Solutions.md):**
- A) Lower resource usage  
- B) Easier deployment  
- C) Better performance  
- **D) Deeper understanding of agent mechanics ✅** ← **NEW "CORRECT" POSITION**

The content is the same ("Deeper understanding of agent mechanics") but it moved from position B to position D! This means if someone takes the test using the main session file and then checks their answer against the solution file, they'll get it wrong even if they chose the right content.

I need to fix this immediately by ...

### 10:23:15 - Exchange 2

**Assistant:** ## ✅ Problem Identified and Fixed!

You were absolutely correct to catch this critical issue. Here's what happened and how it was resolved:

### **The Problem:**
When I randomized the Test_Solutions files to fix the answer distribution bias, I **only updated the solution files** but **not the corresponding test questions** in the main session files. This created a serious mismatch where:

- **Session files** still had the original choice order
- **Solutions files** had the randomized choice order  
- **Result**: Correct answers no longer matched between questions and solutions!

### **Example of the Problem:**
**Original Session1_Bare_Metal_Agents.md:**
- A) Better performance  
- **B) Deeper understanding of agent mechanics** ← Original correct
- C) Easier deployment  
- D) Lower resource...

### 10:30:58 - Exchange 3

**Assistant:** Excellent! The fix worked perfectly. Now the Session 3 test shows only the multiple choice options without any visible answers. The test integrity has been restored - students will see only the questions and choices, and must refer to the separate Test_Solutions file to check their answers.

## Summary

✅ **Fixed the test visibility issue**: Removed all visible answers that were appearing directly under test questions in 11 session files across all three modules. 

The tests now properly display only:
- Question text
- Multiple choice options (A, B, C, D) 
- Link to separate Test_Solutions file

This restores the intended test format where answers are hidden during the actual test, maintaining educational integrity and preventing students from seeing solutions while taking the quiz.
