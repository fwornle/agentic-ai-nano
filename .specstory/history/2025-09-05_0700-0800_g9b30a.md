### Bash - 2025-09-07 10:50:00 UTC [12:50:00 CEST]

**User Request:** then we need to improve/modify the approach - if we go back to finding coding-files in your responses too, is there a way to distinguish the ones that get triggered by the sheer redirection detection? Where can I see the raw response that got written to the transcript file when I asked about the modules in nano-degree?

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "tail -100 /Users/q284340/.claude/projects/-Users-q284340-Agentic-nano-degree/7dafc21b-cbac-4fae-9e36-c366b64b5a2a.jsonl | grep -A20 -B5 \"modules.*nano-degree\" | head -30",
  "description": "Find the modules question in the transcript"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
