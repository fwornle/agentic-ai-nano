**User Request:** have you adjusted the ./install.sh script in coding to include the .dotenv dependency you previously installed during this session? (so that everything works on the next machine we install coding as well)?

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{

### Bash - 2025-09-07 10:50:00 UTC [12:50:00 CEST]

**User Request:** then we need to improve/modify the approach - if we go back to finding coding-files in your responses too, is there a way to distinguish the ones that get triggered by the sheer redirection detection? Where can I see the raw response that got written to the transcript file when I asked about the modules in nano-degree?

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "tail -100 /Users/q284340/.claude/projects/-Users-q284340-Agentic-nano-degree/7dafc21b-cbac-4fae-9e36-c366b64b5a2a.jsonl | grep -A20 -B5 \"modules.*nano-degree\" | head -30",
  "description": "Find the modules question in the transcript"
}

### TodoWrite - 2025-09-05 05:01:27 UTC [07:01:27 CEST]

**User Request:** make a list of all png's included in the nano-degree. I wanna know in which file I can find what image and what caption is carries (if any) and what is depicted on it. I'm mostly concerned about screenshots I included from other publications (not the pumls we created ourselves). Produce the list as JSON. It shall also include a link to the image itself, so I can ask you to find it on the internet (web search with images) and retrieve context information.

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Find all PNG images in nano-degree project",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "activeForm": "Scanning for PNG files"
    },
    {

  "description": "Analyze PNG images in course",
  "prompt": "I need you to analyze all PNG images in the nano-degree course content and create a comprehensive JSON report. Here's what I need:\n\n**Task**: Create a JSON report of all PNG images in /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/ (excluding puml/ subdirectories)\n\n**For each image, I need:**\n1. **filepath**: Full path to the PNG file\n2. **filename**: Just the filename\n3. **directory**: The content module (00_intro, 01_frameworks, etc.)\n4. **markdown_files**: Array of markdown files that reference this image \n5. **captions**: Any alt text, captions, or figure descriptions from the markdown\n6. **context**: What the image depicts (analyze the filename and any surrounding markdown text)\n7. **likely_screenshot**: Boolean indicating if this appears to be a screenshot from external sources rather than our own diagrams\n8. **web_search_url**: The full file:// URL path for potential reverse image searching\n\n**Specific analysis needed:**\n- Search through all .md files in docs-content/ to find image references\n- Look for patterns like `![caption](images/filename.png)` or `<img>` tags\n- Determine from filename/context if image is likely a screenshot from external publications\n- Focus especially on screenshots that might need attribution or source verification\n\n**Output format**: A single JSON array with all image details\n\n**Important**: I'm particularly concerned about screenshots from external sources that might need proper attribution, so mark those clearly in the likely_screenshot field and provide good context about what they show.\n\nPlease search systematically through the markdown files and provide the comprehensive JSON report."
