**User Request:** shouldn't the "LSL generation script" use the "enhanced transcript monitor" code? I don't want parallel functionality!! Make sure that what I use during live classification / live session logging is the same code as is used when running this in batch mode to retroactively turn an entire set of historic transcript files into classified LSL files
