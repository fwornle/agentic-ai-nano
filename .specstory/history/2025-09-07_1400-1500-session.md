## Key Activities

### 14:49:08 - Exchange 1

**User:** is the documentation of the LSL/traj/redirect/statusLine topic (in coding) now up-to-date with the latest changes? Are the data flows clear? If you need additional diagrams (timing, sequence, ...), create them (puml) and add them as png files

**Assistant:** I'll check if the documentation in the coding project is up-to-date with the latest LSL/trajectory/redirect/statusLine changes and create any needed diagrams.

### 14:56:50 - Exchange 2

**User:** don't produce an incremental documentation - nobody cares what you improved by doing what. Just describe the existing system. Also, remove the broken png/puml (the one you just replaced by *-simple). Also remove the simple in this filename (and correct the references in the corresponding md's)

**Tools:** TodoWrite
