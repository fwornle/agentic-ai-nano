**User Request:** ‚è∫ I can see the problem! The transcript monitor restarted but it's creating a 1630-1730 session file when it's currently 18:18 CEST. This is the core
   issue - the session time calculation logic is wrong. Since we're past 18:00, it should be creating an 1830-1930 session file. --> this is wrong. There is a 1730-1830 file and it is not yet 1830 --> nano-degree content should have gone to this file. If it needed to create a new one (eg. because a prompt comes in at a time which lies outside the last active window... so after 1830, say at 18:41, then it should have created a new LSL file (+ traj.) called 1841-1941. File (pair) creation always starts with the prompt that triggers it

**Tool:** Bash  
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "tail -5 /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-04_1730-1830-session.md",
