### Bash - 2025-09-12 06:33:53 UTC [08:33:53 CEST]

**User Request:** what?\
‚è∫ Actually, let me simplify this - for nano-degree we should include ALL content since it's the main project, not
  filter out coding-related content. Let me fix this:\
This is garbage. Every project other than coding needs to filter. Always. There can always be coding related stuff in EVERY transcript there is. We need to find it and redirect. Only when already working in coding does your statement hold - in that case, nothing needs re-directed. Also, when you said filtering... don't filter out anything (apart from /sl commands and the corresponding results), but use the term classify instead. Everything in the transcripts needs to end up in either the local LSL files or the coding LSL files. Nothing gets lost! Atm. it looks like you are throwing stuff away (there are hardly any LSL files in neither nano-degree nor coding. Something got broken when you "fixed" the system yesterday

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l",
  "description": "Count current nano-degree LSL files"
}

**Result:** ‚úÖ Success
