**Request:** now, all we're left to do is fix the trajectory generation. This is what we need to do to recreate the trajectory files in nano-degree 8as a one-off fix): find the oldest LSL file and produce a corresponding transcript file: history/2025-08-09_0730-0830-session.md --> trajectory/2025-08-09_0730-0830-trajectory.md. The content of this file should come from a semantic analysis of project nano-degree (using the mcp-server for sem anal., working on ~/Agentic/nano-degree). It shall be formatted as pe...

**Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
This is a comprehensive technical conversation focused on fixing and enhancing session logging systems, particularly around PlantUML diagram generation and trajectory file management. Let me analyze this chronologically:

1. **Initial PlantUML Issues**: User identified that transcript entries from 2025-09-03 were incorrectly placed in LSL files dated 2025-09-05, i...

**Request:** I don't think you need to execute the "complete-analysis" WS, do you? Isn't the "insight" info from earlier enough for the trajectory file generation? Or are you trying to get deeper insights still?

**Request:** we still had an LSL file with a "-1" in the window. I just tried to correct this to new filename 2025-08-31_2330-0030-session.md - but when I looked at the content, I'm not sure, this is all consistent (timestamps from 01.09. and 02.09., times off... maybe the LSL files around the 31.08. - 02.09. need to be recreated again, making sure the "-1" window reference issue has been resolved (which I figured you had done by now... but maybe not? Or was this just a left-over file that needs to be delete...
