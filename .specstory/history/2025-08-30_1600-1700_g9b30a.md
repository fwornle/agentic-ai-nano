### Text Exchange - 2025-08-30 14:11:14 UTC [16:11:14 CEST]

**User Message:** it seems that you are using a lot of scripts (bash based, pyhthon based, awk, sed, ...) - just to figure out where the code blocks are, how large they are, etc. before they can be broken down. This means that the user needs to approve you running these "on the spot tools"... which means they have to stay with you all the time so that the course-material-refactorer can conclude its job. It also seems like you only ever start these agents one at a time. Also, you seem to have missed larger code bl...

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-30 14:17:42 UTC [16:17:42 CEST]

**User Message:** Using the enhanced autonomous approach, refactor multiple course material files to break down large code blocks (>20 lines) into smaller, well-explained segments.

**Use the new workflow:**
1. Start by running the code block detector script on the entire 01_frameworks directory:
   ```bash
   python3 /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/scripts/detect-large-code-blocks.py docs-content/01_frameworks/
   ```

2. Use the script output to identify ALL files with large code blocks that need refactoring...

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-30 14:45:32 UTC [16:45:32 CEST]

**User Message:** when cutting down on code blocks, you seem to sometimes forget (every third block or so) to properly close the block or start the remainder block with 
```python --> check the agent definition and produce a checker script which corrects these mistakes. This script shall also be run by the agent to ensure, the final result is properly formatted from an md perspective. Also, the code block detector should run at the beginning when making the todo list so that we can properly tick off all blocks wh...

**User Message:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation to understand the user's requests and my responses:

1. **Initial Request**: The user asked me to "refactor module 01_frameworks to reduce large code blocks to smaller chunks with good explanations. Use the course-material-refactorer agent and work in parallel on all md-files of the module"

2. **My Initial Approach*...
