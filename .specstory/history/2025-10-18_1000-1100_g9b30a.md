Hello! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the nano-degree codebase.

I have access to powerful search tools including:
- **Glob patterns** for broad file matching
- **Grep with regex** for searching file contents
- **Read** for viewing specific files
- **Bash** for file operations

I'm currently in `/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree`, which is a clean Git repository on the main branch.

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
