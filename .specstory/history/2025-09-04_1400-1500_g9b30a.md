In addition, these files should be called *-session-from-nano-degree.md (drop the coding). Revise the generating code (transcript monitor) and fix these files. You should be able to re-create the entire set of history files using the script we made for this (which uses the same codebase as the transcript monitor - single source... at least this was our requirement. Use the ingest MCP server on coding to understand the coding codebase, then revise this. We MUST be able to run this script to turn a transcript record into the needed LSL files (local and redirected to coding). The SAME code must be used by the live system (transcript monitor).

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- All sessions are logged locally in the current project's .specstory/history directory
- For multiple sessions, start with most recent and work backwards
- Focus on understanding the project context and previous work completed

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files.

## Steps
1. Find the latest session log file in the current project's .specstory/history folder
2. Read the most recent session log to establish continuity
3. If $ARGUMENTS specifies more than 1, read additional previous session files
4. Summarize all sessions to provide continuity of your awareness and actions across sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- All sessions are logged locally in the current project's .specstory/history directory
- For multiple sessions, start with most recent and work backwards
- Focus on understanding the project context and previous work completed


**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-07_1230-1330-session.md",
  "limit": 50
}
```

**Result:** âœ… Success
