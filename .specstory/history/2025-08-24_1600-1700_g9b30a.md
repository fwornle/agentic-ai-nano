### Text Exchange - 2025-08-24 14:13:15 UTC [16:13:15 CEST]

**User Message:** the CN is still not reckognized reliably - console (in CN / VPN): GitHub Pages detected - checking for corporate access
network-detection.js:56 Running internal service check to detect corporate network access

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-24 14:28:11 UTC [16:28:11 CEST]

**User Message:** it now detects the CN. However, it is "hiding the BMW content" nonetheless (see console: [Image #2]). Also, as soon as we click on the first sidebar entry (BMW...), sidebar and page content switches back to public: [Image #3]

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-24 14:39:12 UTC [16:39:12 CEST]

**User Message:** where is the Coder content? (00_intro/coder.md)? Same question for Gaia LLM API. As soon as I click the sidebar ([Image #1]) it switches to the public only content: [Image #2] --> the detection might work now, but the use of the isCorporateNetworkDetected state is not... check and fix - this should be much easier!!

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-24 14:42:08 UTC [16:42:08 CEST]

**User Message:** Also, remove the check for 10.xxx.yy.zz - it introduces unnecessary latency in the detection of the public space - check for the internal BMW hompage should be sufficient

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-24 14:49:26 UTC [16:49:26 CEST]

**User Message:** why is it not possible for you to display the right content to go with the sidebar? It seems that you now control the sidebar contents wrt. the detected CN vs. public situation. However, you fail to display the corresponding content (It's not the CN content). You should display file 00_intro/coder.md and llmapi.md. Also, you still have probably no longer used files 00_intro/coder-bmw.md and ... check those and tidy up

### Text Exchange - 2025-08-24 14:58:36 UTC [16:58:36 CEST]

**User Message:** only with a hard reload can I get the coder content to be displayed (when a previous run detected CN). It seems that, once detected, the state is frozen, even if the user logs into the CN (or out). Check and fix. Also, you failed to fix the llmapi (similarly to what you just did for coder)... in CN, it shows the BMW sidebar entries (Gaia...), but the main content is the public one
