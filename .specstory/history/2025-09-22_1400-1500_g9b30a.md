The implementation is complete and ready. The sophisticated markdown renderer has been integrated into the network-detection-unified.js file with the following key improvements:

**✅ Sophisticated Markdown Processing:**
- Advanced code block handling with language detection
- Proper heading generation with automatic ID creation for navigation
- Comprehensive image processing with base64 conversion for encrypted images
- Robust list handling (both unordered and numbered)
- Smart paragraph processing that preserves existing HTML structure

**✅ Complete Image Support:**
- Base64 conversion for encrypted corporate images
- Fallback handling for shared public images
- Proper MIME type detection and data URL generation
- Path normalization for different image reference patterns

**✅ Content Architecture:**
- All required files are encrypted and available (16 total files including Session 10)
- Concise coder setup as primary content with detailed version accessible via link
- Error handling with clear messages instead of fallbacks
- Complete decoupling of network detection, content decryption, and markdown rendering

**✅ System Integration:**
- Visual indicators working (1.5 second display duration as requested)
- Backward compatibility maintained with `window.isCorporateNetworkDetected`
- Old content loader completely disabled to prevent conflicts
- Event-driven architecture for reliable state management

The system should now properly display corporate content with working images and correct HTML formatting for both the coder pages and Session 10 when accessed from the corporate network.
