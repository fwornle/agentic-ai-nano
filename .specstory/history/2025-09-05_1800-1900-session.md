### 18:44:27 - Exchange 2

**Assistant:** Perfect! The timezone-handling diagram has been redesigned with a vertical layout instead of horizontal:

## Changes Made:

1. **Vertical Layout**: Reorganized from 4 horizontal rectangles to 3 vertical sections
2. **Logical Grouping**: 
   - **Configuration & Input**: Combined timezone config and input sources
   - **Time Processing**: Window calculation and time window logic  
   - **Output Generation**: All output files and displays
3. **Compact Time Windows**: Nested the time window examples in a more compact format
4. **Top-to-bottom Flow**: Arrows now flow vertically, making the diagram much narrower

The diagram now flows naturally from top to bottom (Configuration → Processing → Output) and should display well without requiring horizontal scrolling or zooming!
