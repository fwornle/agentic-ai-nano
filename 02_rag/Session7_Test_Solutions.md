# Session 7: Agentic RAG Systems - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

### Question 1: Query Planning Advantage
**What is the primary advantage of query planning in agentic RAG systems?**

A) Faster response times  
B) Strategic analysis of queries to determine optimal retrieval and generation approaches ‚úÖ  
C) Reduced computational costs  
D) Simpler system architecture  

**Explanation:** Query planning enables agentic RAG systems to analyze query complexity and characteristics, then determine the optimal approach (simple retrieval, multi-hop reasoning, tool integration, etc.). This strategic analysis leads to better results rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach to all queries.

### Question 2: Self-Correction Error Detection
**In self-correcting RAG systems, what is the most effective approach for error detection?**

A) Random response sampling  
B) LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with factual consistency checking ‚úÖ  
C) Simple keyword matching  
D) Response length validation  

**Explanation:** LLM-as-a-judge evaluation can assess factual consistency, logical coherence, and completeness of responses against the retrieved context. This sophisticated evaluation captures subtle errors that simple heuristics would miss, enabling effective self-correction.

### Question 3: External Tool Usage Criteria
**When should agentic RAG systems use external tools rather than just document retrieval?**

A) Always, for every query  
B) Never, document retrieval is always sufficient  
C) When queries require real-time data, calculations, or specialized functionality ‚úÖ  
D) Only for simple questions  

**Explanation:** External tools should be used when document retrieval alone cannot satisfy the query requirements. This includes real-time information (weather, stock prices), mathematical calculations, database queries, or specialized API calls that provide capabilities beyond static document content.

---

### Question 4: Multi-Agent Collaboration Benefits
**What is the key benefit of multi-agent collaboration in RAG systems?**

A) Faster processing through parallel execution  
B) Specialized expertise and comprehensive analysis through role-based collaboration ‚úÖ  
C) Reduced memory usage  
D) Simpler error handling  

**Explanation:** Multi-agent collaboration leverages specialized agents (researcher, analyzer, synthesizer, validator) that each bring focused expertise to their role. This specialization enables more thorough analysis and higher-quality synthesis than a single general-purpose agent could achieve.

---

### Question 5: Self-Correction Stopping Criteria
**In iterative self-correction, what criterion should determine when to stop refinement?**

A) Fixed number of iterations regardless of quality  
B) Quality threshold achievement or diminishing improvement returns ‚úÖ  
C) Time limits only  
D) User interruption  

**Explanation:** Effective stopping criteria should be based on quality metrics - either achieving a satisfactory quality threshold or detecting that additional iterations provide diminishing returns. This ensures resources aren't wasted on unnecessary refinement while maintaining quality standards.

---

### Question 6: Critical Agent Role for Accuracy
**Which agent role is most critical for ensuring factual accuracy in multi-agent RAG systems?**

A) Researcher agent  
B) Synthesizer agent  
C) Validator agent ‚úÖ  
D) Coordinator agent  

**Explanation:** The validator agent is specifically responsible for checking factual accuracy, logical consistency, and overall response quality. While other agents contribute to accuracy, the validator agent has the specialized role of ensuring the final response meets accuracy standards.

---

### Question 7: Production Deployment Challenge
**What is the primary challenge in production deployment of agentic RAG systems?**

A) High computational costs  
B) Balancing system complexity with reliability and performance ‚úÖ  
C) Lack of suitable frameworks  
D) Limited use cases  

**Explanation:** Agentic RAG systems are inherently more complex than traditional RAG, with multiple components, iterative processes, and decision points. The key challenge is maintaining this sophistication while ensuring the system remains reliable, performant, and manageable in production environments.

---

### Question 8: Validation Assessment Priority
**When designing agentic RAG validation, what aspect is most important to assess?**

A) Response length  
B) Processing speed  
C) Factual accuracy and logical consistency ‚úÖ  
D) Token usage  

**Explanation:** Factual accuracy and logical consistency are paramount in RAG systems, as users rely on these systems for reliable information. While performance metrics matter, incorrect or inconsistent information undermines the fundamental value proposition of RAG systems.
