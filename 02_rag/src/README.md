## Session 7: Agentic RAG Systems

**Core Concepts:** Reasoning-driven retrieval, chain-of-thought integration, self-correcting systems

### Files Created:
- `reasoning_augmented_retrieval.py` - RAG system where reasoning frameworks guide retrieval strategies
- `retrieval_augmented_reasoning.py` - System that uses retrieved information to enhance reasoning capabilities
- `chain_of_thought_rag.py` - RAG system with integrated chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities
- `node_rag_reasoning_bridge.py` - Bridge between NodeRAG structured knowledge and reasoning capabilities
- `reasoning_driven_query_planner.py` - Advanced agentic RAG with query planning and cognitive orchestration
- `self_correcting_rag.py` - Reasoning-based self-correcting RAG with logical validation and cognitive correction
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies for Session 7

### Key Features:
- **Reasoning-Guided Retrieval**: Systems that use logical frameworks to guide what information to retrieve
- **Chain-of-Thought Integration**: Step-by-step reasoning processes integrated with RAG
- **Self-Correction**: Autonomous validation and improvement of responses using logical reasoning
- **Query Planning**: Intelligent decomposition and planning of complex queries
- **Cognitive Orchestration**: Advanced planning and execution of reasoning-driven RAG workflows

## Session 8: Multi-Modal Advanced RAG

**Core Concepts:** Multi-modal content processing, MRAG evolution (1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0), cross-modal fusion

### Files Created:
- `multimodal_rag_system.py` - Comprehensive multi-modal RAG system with content processing
- `mrag_evolution.py` - MRAG Evolution System demonstrating 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0 progression
- `multimodal_vector_store.py` - Multi-modal vector storage and retrieval system
- `multimodal_rag_fusion.py` - MRAG 3.0 Autonomous Multimodal RAG-Fusion implementation
- `ensemble_rag.py` - Ensemble RAG system combining multiple models and strategies
- `domain_rag_systems.py` - Domain-specific RAG systems for legal and medical applications
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies for Session 8

### Key Features:
- **MRAG 1.0**: Text-centric approach with lossy conversion (demonstrates limitations)
- **MRAG 2.0**: True multimodal processing with semantic integrity preservation  
- **MRAG 3.0**: Autonomous multimodal intelligence with dynamic reasoning
- **Cross-Modal Fusion**: Advanced fusion strategies for combining different modalities
- **Domain Specialization**: Legal and medical RAG systems with safety and accuracy focus

## Session 9: Production RAG & Enterprise Integration

**Core Concepts:** Scalable deployment, enterprise integration, security, monitoring, compliance

### Files Created:
- `production_rag_orchestrator.py` - Production-ready containerized RAG system orchestrator
- `load_balancer_autoscaler.py` - Load balancing and auto-scaling for RAG services
- `enterprise_integration.py` - Enterprise integration framework for data systems and workflows
- `privacy_compliance.py` - Privacy and compliance framework (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- `incremental_indexing.py` - Real-time indexing and incremental update system
- `monitoring_analytics.py` - Production monitoring and observability system
- `production_deployment.py` - Complete production RAG deployment system
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies for Session 9

### Key Features:
- **Microservices Architecture**: Containerized services with orchestration and load balancing
- **Enterprise Integration**: SharePoint, databases, file systems, APIs
- **Security & Compliance**: RBAC, GDPR/HIPAA compliance, audit logging
- **Real-Time Processing**: Change detection, incremental updates, event-driven architecture
- **Production Monitoring**: Metrics, alerting, analytics, health checks
- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on load and performance metrics

## Usage Instructions

### Installation

Each session has its own requirements file. Install dependencies for the session you want to work with:

```bash
# For Session 7
cd src/session7
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Session 8  
cd src/session8
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Session 9
cd src/session9
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Code

The code is designed to be modular and extensible. Each file contains classes and functions that can be imported and used:

```python
# Example: Using Session 7 reasoning systems
from session7.reasoning_augmented_retrieval import ReasoningAugmentedRetrieval
from session7.chain_of_thought_rag import ChainOfThoughtRAG

# Example: Using Session 8 multimodal systems
from session8.multimodal_rag_system import MultiModalProcessor
from session8.mrag_evolution import MRAG_3_0_AutonomousSystem

# Example: Using Session 9 production systems
from session9.production_deployment import ProductionRAGDeployment
from session9.monitoring_analytics import RAGMonitoringSystem
```

### Configuration

Most systems accept configuration dictionaries for customization:

```python
# Example configuration for production deployment
config = {
    'services': {...},
    'enterprise_integration': {...},
    'monitoring': {...},
    'auto_scaling': {...}
}

deployment = ProductionRAGDeployment(config)
await deployment.deploy_production_system()
```

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your session** based on your interests:
   - **Session 7**: Advanced reasoning and agentic capabilities
   - **Session 8**: Multi-modal content processing
   - **Session 9**: Production deployment and enterprise features

2. **Install dependencies** using the session's requirements.txt
