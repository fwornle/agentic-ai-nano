# Session 0: Introduction to RAG Architecture & Evolution - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

### Question 1: RAG Architecture Components
**What are the three main stages of a RAG system?**

A) Parse, Search, Respond  
B) Index, Retrieve, Generate ‚úÖ  
C) Chunk, Embed, Query  
D) Store, Find, Answer  

**Explanation:** The RAG architecture consists of three fundamental stages: (1) **Index** - offline preparation where documents are processed, chunked, and stored; (2) **Retrieve** - real-time phase where relevant information is found; (3) **Generate** - synthesis phase where retrieved context enhances LLM responses.

### Question 2: RAG Evolution Timeline
**Which RAG evolution phase introduced self-correcting mechanisms?**

A) 2020 - RAG Foundation  
B) 2022 - LLM Integration  
C) 2023 - Adaptive RAG ‚úÖ  
D) 2025 - Next-Gen RAG  

**Explanation:** The 2023 Adaptive & Intelligent RAG phase introduced breakthrough concepts like Self-RAG with self-reflective retrieval-augmented generation, adaptive retrieval triggering, and self-correcting retrieval mechanisms.

### Question 3: HyDE Technique
**What is the primary advantage of HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)?**

A) Reduces computational cost  
B) Improves query-document semantic alignment ‚úÖ  
C) Eliminates need for vector databases  
D) Simplifies system architecture  

**Explanation:** HyDE generates hypothetical documents that would answer the query, improving retrieval by matching against document-like content rather than just queries. This bridges the semantic gap between short queries and longer documents.

### Question 4: RAG vs Fine-tuning Decision
**When should you choose RAG over fine-tuning?**

A) When the domain knowledge is static  
B) When you need frequent knowledge updates ‚úÖ  
C) When computational resources are unlimited  
D) When source attribution is not needed  

**Explanation:** RAG excels when knowledge needs to be updated frequently because it can incorporate new information without expensive model retraining. Fine-tuning is better for static domain knowledge, while RAG is ideal for dynamic, evolving knowledge bases.

### Question 5: Agentic RAG Benefits
**What is the key benefit of Agentic RAG systems?**

A) Faster retrieval speed  
B) Lower computational requirements  
C) Iterative query refinement and self-correction ‚úÖ  
D) Simpler system architecture  

**Explanation:** Agentic RAG systems can iteratively refine queries, self-correct when initial results are poor, and adapt their retrieval strategy based on the quality of retrieved information. This makes them more robust and accurate than simple RAG pipelines.
