# Session 0: Introduction to RAG Architecture - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test Solutions

### Question 1: RAG System Architecture
**What are the three main stages of a RAG system?**

A) Parse, Search, Respond
B) Index, Retrieve, Generate ‚úÖ
C) Chunk, Embed, Query
D) Store, Find, Answer

**Explanation:** The fundamental RAG architecture consists of three main stages: (1) **Index** - offline preprocessing where documents are chunked, embedded, and stored in vector databases; (2) **Retrieve** - real-time similarity search to find relevant context for user queries; (3) **Generate** - LLM synthesis of retrieved context into coherent responses. This three-stage pipeline forms the backbone of all RAG systems.

### Question 2: RAG Evolution Timeline
**Which RAG evolution phase introduced self-correcting mechanisms?**

A) 2020 - RAG Foundation
B) 2022 - LLM Integration
C) 2023 - Adaptive RAG ‚úÖ
D) 2025 - Next-Gen RAG

**Explanation:** The 2023 Adaptive RAG phase introduced self-correcting mechanisms through Self-RAG and Corrective RAG (CRAG) systems. These systems could evaluate their own outputs, decide when to retrieve additional information, and refine responses through multiple iterations. This marked the transition from static "retrieve-then-generate" to intelligent, self-correcting architectures.

### Question 3: HyDE Technology
**What is the primary advantage of HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)?**

A) Reduces computational cost
B) Improves query-document semantic alignment ‚úÖ
C) Eliminates need for vector databases
D) Simplifies system architecture

**Explanation:** HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) bridges the semantic gap between user queries and document content by generating hypothetical documents that would answer the query, then searching with those documents instead of the original query. This dramatically improves retrieval because hypothetical answers exist in the same semantic space as actual documents, leading to better query-document alignment.

### Question 4: RAG vs Fine-tuning Decision
**When should you choose RAG over fine-tuning?**

A) When the domain knowledge is static
B) When you need frequent knowledge updates ‚úÖ
C) When computational resources are unlimited
D) When source attribution is not needed

**Explanation:** RAG is superior when knowledge needs frequent updates because it can incorporate new information without expensive model retraining. Fine-tuning is better for static domain knowledge, but RAG excels when you need to add new documents, update facts, or access real-time information while maintaining source attribution and transparency.

### Question 5: Agentic RAG Systems
**What is the key benefit of Agentic RAG systems?**

A) Faster retrieval speed
B) Lower computational requirements
C) Iterative query refinement and self-correction ‚úÖ
D) Simpler system architecture

**Explanation:** Agentic RAG systems (2024-2025 evolution) employ multiple specialized agents that can iteratively refine queries, self-correct responses, and coordinate complex reasoning workflows. This enables sophisticated planning, multi-hop reasoning, and autonomous knowledge acquisition that far exceeds simple retrieve-and-generate approaches.

---

### Question 6: Intelligent Chunking
**Which problem does intelligent chunking primarily solve?**

A) Slow retrieval speed
B) High computational costs
C) Loss of document structure and semantic coherence ‚úÖ
D) Limited storage capacity

**Explanation:** Intelligent chunking addresses the critical problem of preserving document structure and semantic coherence during the indexing process. Naive character-based splitting destroys meaning by cutting through paragraphs, tables, and logical sections. Smart chunking preserves semantic boundaries, maintaining context and improving retrieval quality.

---

### Question 7: Indexing Stage Purpose
**What is the main purpose of the indexing stage in RAG?**

A) Generate responses to user queries
B) Transform documents into searchable vector representations ‚úÖ
C) Validate response accuracy
D) Handle user authentication

**Explanation:** The indexing stage is the offline preparation phase that transforms raw documents into searchable vector representations. This involves document parsing, chunking, embedding generation, and vector database storage. It's the foundation that enables fast semantic search during the retrieval stage.

---

### Question 8: Semantic Query Enhancement
**Why is semantic query enhancement important in RAG systems?**

A) It reduces storage requirements
B) It speeds up vector database queries
C) It bridges the gap between user language and document content ‚úÖ
D) It simplifies the system architecture

**Explanation:** Semantic query enhancement (including techniques like HyDE and query expansion) is crucial because users often phrase questions differently than how information appears in documents. Enhancement techniques bridge this semantic gap by generating multiple query representations, improving the likelihood of finding relevant content.

---

### Question 9: Legal RAG Specialization
**What distinguishes legal RAG systems from general RAG implementations?**

A) Faster processing speed
B) Lower accuracy requirements
C) Specialized components for citations and jurisdictional awareness ‚úÖ
D) Simpler query processing

**Explanation:** Legal RAG systems require specialized components including LegalBERT embeddings for legal language understanding, hierarchical indexing for legal document structure, citation-aware retrieval systems, and jurisdiction-specific processing. The extreme accuracy requirements and specialized formatting needs of legal work demand these domain-specific adaptations.

---

### Question 10: RAG Generator Component
**Which component is responsible for combining retrieved context with user queries?**

A) Vector database
B) Embedding model
C) RAG Generator ‚úÖ
D) Document chunker

**Explanation:** The RAG Generator is responsible for the synthesis phase where retrieved context is combined with user queries to generate coherent responses. It builds augmented prompts, manages context integration, and uses LLMs to produce final answers grounded in the retrieved information.
