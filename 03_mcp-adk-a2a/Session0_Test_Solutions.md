A) Functions, Data, and Templates  
B) Tools, Resources, and Prompts ‚úÖ  
C) APIs, Databases, and Services  
D) Commands, Files, and Scripts  

**Explanation:** MCP servers expose three types of capabilities: Tools (functions that agents can call), Resources (data sources that agents can read), and Prompts (reusable prompt templates for common tasks).

---

### Question 4: ADK Framework
**Which Google technology provides a flexible orchestration framework for developing AI agents?**

A) Gemini  
B) Vertex AI  
C) ADK (Agent Development Kit) ‚úÖ  
D) Cloud Functions  

**Explanation:** Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) is the flexible orchestration framework designed for developing sophisticated AI agents with built-in error handling, state management, and tool integration.

---

### Question 5: ADK Advantages
**What is a key advantage of ADK compared to traditional AI frameworks?**

A) It requires less code  
B) It has built-in orchestration and error handling ‚úÖ  
C) It works only with Google models  
D) It's completely visual  

**Explanation:** ADK provides production-ready orchestration capabilities, comprehensive error handling, and robust state management out-of-the-box, unlike traditional frameworks that require custom implementation of these features.

---

### Question 6: A2A Communication
**What does A2A stand for in the context of AI systems?**

A) Agent-to-API  
B) Agent-to-Agent ‚úÖ  
C) Application-to-Application  
D) API-to-API  

**Explanation:** A2A stands for Agent-to-Agent communication, enabling direct interaction between autonomous AI agents across different systems and organizations.

---

### Question 7: A2A Benefits
**What is the primary benefit of A2A communication?**

A) Faster processing  
B) Direct autonomous agent collaboration ‚úÖ  
C) Lower costs  
D) Better security  

**Explanation:** A2A enables autonomous agents to collaborate directly without human intervention, creating more efficient and scalable AI systems that can work together to solve complex problems.

---

### Question 8: Integration Architecture
**In a typical enterprise integration using all three protocols, which handles external data access?**

A) ADK  
B) A2A  
C) MCP ‚úÖ  
D) All three equally  

**Explanation:** MCP specifically handles standardized access to external data sources, APIs, and tools, while ADK manages agent orchestration and A2A enables inter-agent communication.

---

### Question 9: MCP Transport
**Which transport methods does MCP support?**

A) HTTP only  
B) WebSocket only  
C) Both HTTP and WebSocket ‚úÖ  
D) TCP only  

**Explanation:** MCP supports multiple transport methods including HTTP for request-response patterns and WebSocket for real-time, bidirectional communication.

---

### Question 10: ADK Components
**Which of the following is NOT a core component of ADK?**

A) Agents  
B) Tools  
C) Sessions  
D) Databases ‚úÖ  

**Explanation:** ADK core components include Agents (LLM, workflow, custom), Tools (pre-built, MCP, third-party), Runners (execution flow), Sessions (persistent context), and Events (execution steps). Databases are external resources that can be accessed through MCP.

---

### Question 11: Enterprise Use Case
**Which scenario best demonstrates the power of combining MCP, ADK, and A2A?**

A) A single agent answering questions  
B) Multiple agents coordinating across departments with external data access ‚úÖ  
C) Simple API calls  
D) File processing only  

**Explanation:** The combination shines in complex enterprise scenarios where multiple specialized agents need to coordinate (A2A), access various external systems (MCP), while being orchestrated efficiently (ADK).

---

### Question 12: Development Strategy
**What is the recommended approach for learning these three protocols?**

A) Start with the most complex  
B) Learn all simultaneously  
C) Start with MCP, then build up to ADK and A2A ‚úÖ  
D) Start with A2A first  

**Explanation:** Starting with MCP provides the foundation for external integrations, then ADK for agent orchestration, and finally A2A for multi-agent coordination builds knowledge progressively.

---

### Question 13: MCP Inspector Tool
**What is the primary purpose of the MCP Inspector?**

A) Code debugging  
B) Testing and validating MCP server implementations ‚úÖ  
C) Performance monitoring  
D) Security scanning  

**Explanation:** MCP Inspector provides a graphical interface for testing MCP servers, validating tool implementations, and debugging protocol interactions before production deployment.

---

### Question 14: A2A Problem Solving
**Which of the following is NOT a key problem that A2A solves?**

A) Agent discovery  
B) Communication standards  
C) Model training optimization ‚úÖ  
D) Cross-organization collaboration  

**Explanation:** A2A focuses on agent discovery, standardized communication protocols, and enabling collaboration across organizations. Model training optimization is handled by other technologies and frameworks.

---

### Question 15: Learning Path
**What is the recommended development path for mastering these protocols?**

A) Start with A2A, then ACP, then MCP  
B) Start with ACP, then MCP, then A2A  
C) Start with MCP, then ACP, then A2A ‚úÖ  
D) Learn all three simultaneously  

**Explanation:** The progressive path from MCP (external integrations) to ADK (agent orchestration) to A2A (multi-agent coordination) builds foundational knowledge before advancing to complex multi-agent systems.
