# Session 9: Production Agent Deployment - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

### Question 1: Container Orchestration
**What is the primary benefit of using Kubernetes for production agent deployment?**

A) Lower costs  
B) Auto-scaling, service discovery, and resource management ‚úÖ  
C) Simpler development  
D) Better security by default  

**Explanation:** Kubernetes provides comprehensive container orchestration including auto-scaling based on demand, service discovery for dynamic routing, and sophisticated resource management across clusters.

---

### Question 2: High Availability
**What uptime target is typically expected for production agent systems?**

A) 95%  
B) 98%  
C) 99.9%+ ‚úÖ  
D) 90%  

**Explanation:** Production agent systems typically target 99.9%+ uptime (8.76 hours downtime per year) to meet enterprise requirements for mission-critical applications.

---

### Question 3: Service Mesh
**What primary benefit does Istio provide in production agent deployments?**

A) Faster execution  
B) Secure service-to-service communication with traffic management ‚úÖ  
C) Lower resource usage  
D) Simpler configuration  

**Explanation:** Istio service mesh provides secure service-to-service communication, traffic management, load balancing, and observability without requiring application code changes.

---

### Question 4: Configuration Management
**Why is centralized configuration management important for production agent systems?**

A) Reduces development time  
B) Enables consistent configuration across environments and version control ‚úÖ  
C) Improves performance  
D) Simplifies testing  

**Explanation:** Centralized configuration management ensures consistent settings across environments, enables version control of configurations, and supports dynamic configuration updates without redeployment.

---

### Question 5: Auto-scaling Triggers
**What metrics should trigger auto-scaling in production agent systems?**

A) CPU usage only  
B) CPU usage, memory usage, queue depth, and response time ‚úÖ  
C) Memory usage only  
D) Network bandwidth only  

**Explanation:** Effective auto-scaling uses multiple metrics including CPU, memory, message queue depth, and response time to make informed scaling decisions based on actual system demand.

---

### Question 6: Observability Stack
**What are the three pillars of observability for production agent systems?**

A) CPU, Memory, Disk  
B) Metrics, logs, and distributed tracing ‚úÖ  
C) Alerts, dashboards, reports  
D) Monitoring, testing, deployment  

**Explanation:** The three pillars of observability are metrics (quantitative data), logs (detailed event records), and distributed tracing (request flow tracking) for comprehensive system visibility.

---

### Question 7: Secrets Management
**How should sensitive information be handled in Kubernetes agent deployments?**

A) Environment variables in deployment files  
B) Kubernetes Secrets with encryption at rest ‚úÖ  
C) Configuration files in containers  
D) Hard-coded in application code  

**Explanation:** Kubernetes Secrets provide secure storage for sensitive information with encryption at rest, access controls, and automatic mounting into containers without exposing values in deployment configurations.

---

### Question 8: CI/CD Pipeline
**What testing approach is recommended for production agent deployments?**

A) Manual testing only  
B) Automated testing with staging environment validation ‚úÖ  
C) Production testing only  
D) No testing required  

**Explanation:** Production deployments require automated testing pipelines including unit tests, integration tests, and validation in staging environments that mirror production conditions.

---

### Question 9: Resource Optimization
**What Kubernetes feature helps optimize resource utilization in agent deployments?**

A) Manual resource allocation  
B) Resource requests and limits with horizontal pod autoscaling ‚úÖ  
C) Fixed resource assignments  
D) No resource management  

**Explanation:** Resource requests and limits combined with horizontal pod autoscaling ensure efficient resource utilization by guaranteeing minimum resources while preventing resource hogging and enabling dynamic scaling.

---

### Question 10: Disaster Recovery
**What is essential for disaster recovery in production agent systems?**

A) Daily backups only  
B) Multi-region deployment with automated failover ‚úÖ  
C) Single data center with backups  
D) Manual recovery procedures  

**Explanation:** Disaster recovery requires multi-region deployment with automated failover capabilities, ensuring system availability even during regional outages or major infrastructure failures.
