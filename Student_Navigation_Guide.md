## Choosing Your Learning Track: 2-Minute Assessment

Before starting, take this quick assessment to find your optimal learning track. You can change tracks anytime, so don't worry about making the "perfect" choice initially.

### Question 1: Learning Preference
**How do you prefer to learn new technical concepts?**

A) **Understand the "why" before the "how"** - I want to grasp the concepts and architecture before diving into code  
B) **Learn by doing** - I prefer following along with guided examples and building as I learn  
C) **Build from scratch** - I want to understand everything deeply and implement advanced features  

### Question 2: Time Availability
**How much focused time can you typically dedicate per learning session?**

A) **15-30 minutes** - I prefer shorter, flexible sessions that fit around my schedule  
B) **30-60 minutes** - I can dedicate regular, structured learning blocks  
C) **60+ minutes** - I prefer intensive, deep-dive sessions where I can fully immerse  

### Question 3: Technical Experience
**What's your current experience with agent frameworks?**

A) **New to agents** - I understand the basics of AI/ML but agents are new territory  
B) **Some experience** - I've worked with APIs and have basic programming skills  
C) **Experienced developer** - I'm comfortable with complex codebases and system design  

### Question 4: Learning Goals
**What's your primary goal for this course?**

A) **Understand the landscape** - I want to know what's possible and make informed decisions  
B) **Build practical skills** - I want hands-on experience creating functional agent systems  
C) **Master the technology** - I want deep expertise for advanced implementations  

### Your Recommended Track

**Mostly A's: Observer Track** 🔍
*Perfect for concept-first learning and architectural understanding*

**Mostly B's: Participant Track** 🛠️ 
*Ideal for balanced learning with guided hands-on practice*

**Mostly C's: Implementer Track** ⚡
*Best for deep technical mastery and advanced implementations*

**Mixed Results?** Start with Participant Track - it offers the best balance and you can easily explore other tracks as you progress.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I'm Not Sure Which Track Is Right for Me"
**Solution**: Start with Participant track for one session, then try the same session in Observer and Implementer tracks. You'll quickly feel which approach resonates best.

### "I'm Falling Behind My Original Schedule"
**Solution**: Switch to Observer track temporarily to maintain momentum, then return to hands-on tracks when you have more time. Progress is progress!

### "The Code Examples Don't Work in My Environment"
**Solution**: 
1. Check our environment troubleshooting guide
2. Use the community forums for environment-specific help
3. Try the cloud-based coding environment (no setup required)
4. Contact support for personalized environment assistance

### "I Want to Mix and Match Different Track Approaches"
**Solution**: Absolutely! Many successful learners do exactly this:
- Start each session with Observer for context
- Switch to Participant for hands-on learning
- Use Implementer for topics most relevant to your work

### "I'm Not Getting Enough Hands-On Practice"
**Solution**: 
- Switch from Observer to Participant track
- Complete bonus practice exercises in each session
- Join study groups for collaborative coding sessions
- Work on the optional extended projects

### "The Pace Feels Too Fast/Too Slow"
**Solution**:
