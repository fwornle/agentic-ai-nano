# Session 4: Production MCP Deployment - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

### Question 1: Production Requirements
**What is the primary difference between development and production MCP servers?**

A) Production servers use different protocols  
B) Production servers require observability, scalability, and reliability ‚úÖ  
C) Production servers are slower than development servers  
D) Production servers only work with specific LLMs  

**Explanation:** Production environments require comprehensive observability (metrics, logs, traces), scalability to handle varying loads, and reliability through error handling and fault tolerance.

---

### Question 2: Containerization Benefits
**What is the main advantage of containerizing MCP servers with Docker?**

A) Improved performance  
B) Consistent environments across development and production ‚úÖ  
C) Better security by default  
D) Automatic scaling capabilities  

**Explanation:** Docker containerization ensures consistent environments across development, staging, and production, eliminating "works on my machine" problems and simplifying deployment.

---

### Question 3: Prometheus Metrics
**Which Prometheus metric type is best suited for tracking response times?**

A) Counter  
B) Gauge  
C) Histogram ‚úÖ  
D) Summary  

**Explanation:** Histogram metrics are ideal for tracking response times as they measure distributions and provide percentiles, helping identify performance patterns and outliers.

---

### Question 4: Health Checks
**What information should a comprehensive health check endpoint provide?**

A) Only HTTP 200 status  
B) Server uptime only  
C) Database connectivity and dependent services status ‚úÖ  
D) Current server load only  

**Explanation:** Health checks should verify all critical dependencies including database connectivity, external service availability, and resource utilization to provide comprehensive system status.

---

### Question 5: Auto-scaling Strategy
**What metric is most important for auto-scaling MCP servers?**

A) CPU utilization only  
B) Memory usage only  
C) Request rate combined with response time ‚úÖ  
D) Network bandwidth only  

**Explanation:** Request rate combined with response time provides the best indicator of actual user demand and system performance, enabling more accurate scaling decisions than resource metrics alone.

---

### Question 6: Caching Implementation
**What type of caching is most effective for MCP server responses?**

A) In-memory caching only  
B) Redis distributed caching with TTL expiration ‚úÖ  
C) File-based caching  
D) Database-level caching only  

**Explanation:** Redis distributed caching with TTL expiration provides fast access, data persistence, and automatic cleanup while supporting multiple server instances in production environments.

---

### Question 7: Circuit Breaker Pattern
**When should a circuit breaker transition to the "open" state?**

A) When the server starts up  
B) When error rates exceed the configured threshold ‚úÖ  
C) When response times are slightly elevated  
D) When memory usage is high  

**Explanation:** Circuit breakers open when error rates exceed configured thresholds, preventing cascade failures by temporarily stopping requests to failing services until they recover.

---

### Question 8: CI/CD Pipeline
**What is the recommended approach for deploying MCP servers through CI/CD?**

A) Direct deployment to production  
B) Blue-green deployment with health checks ‚úÖ  
C) Rolling updates without testing  
D) Manual deployment verification  

**Explanation:** Blue-green deployment with health checks ensures zero-downtime deployments by maintaining two identical environments and switching traffic only after verifying the new version's health.

---

### Question 9: Monitoring Strategy
**Which monitoring approach provides the most comprehensive observability?**

A) Logs only  
B) Metrics only  
C) The three pillars: metrics, logs, and distributed tracing ‚úÖ  
D) Health checks only  

**Explanation:** The three pillars of observability (metrics, logs, and distributed tracing) provide comprehensive system visibility, enabling effective troubleshooting and performance optimization.

---

### Question 10: Infrastructure as Code
**What is the primary benefit of using Terraform for MCP server infrastructure?**

A) Improved security  
B) Faster deployment  
C) Reproducible and version-controlled infrastructure ‚úÖ  
D) Lower costs  

**Explanation:** Infrastructure as Code with Terraform ensures reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure that can be reviewed, tested, and deployed consistently across environments.
