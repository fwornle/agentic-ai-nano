# Session 2: Building a Secure File System MCP Server - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test - Session 2

**Question 1:** What is the primary purpose of the sandbox in our file system server?  

A) To improve performance  
B) To prevent unauthorized file access ‚úÖ  
C) To compress files  
D) To cache file contents  

**Explanation:** The sandbox is the critical security boundary that restricts all file operations to a designated directory, preventing access to sensitive system files and implementing defense-in-depth security.

**Question 2:** Which method is used to safely resolve file paths and prevent directory traversal attacks?  

A) `os.path.join()`  
B) `Path.resolve()` ‚úÖ  
C) `str.replace()`  
D) `Path.absolute()`  

**Explanation:** `Path.resolve()` resolves all symlinks and normalizes paths (including `..` components), which is essential for preventing directory traversal attacks like `../../../etc/passwd`.

**Question 3:** How are binary files handled in the read_file tool?  

A) Rejected with an error  
B) Converted to hexadecimal  
C) Encoded as base64 ‚úÖ  
D) Read as UTF-8  

**Explanation:** Binary files are encoded as base64 strings for safe transmission through the JSON-RPC protocol, since JSON cannot directly contain binary data.

**Question 4:** What type of validation is performed on file types for security?  

A) Extension only  
B) MIME type only  
C) Both extension and MIME type ‚úÖ  
D) File size only  

**Explanation:** The server validates both the file extension (user-provided) and MIME type (content-based detection) to prevent disguised malicious files and ensure accurate file type identification.

**Question 5:** Which logging level is used for security violations in the file system server?  

A) DEBUG  
B) INFO  
C) WARNING ‚úÖ  
D) ERROR  

**Explanation:** Security violations like sandbox escape attempts are logged at WARNING level to indicate suspicious activity that should be monitored but doesn't necessarily break the application.

**Question 6:** What happens when a file path attempts to escape the sandbox?  

A) The server crashes  
B) A SandboxError is raised ‚úÖ  
C) The path is automatically corrected  
D) Access is granted with a warning  

**Explanation:** The server raises a SandboxError exception when paths attempt to escape the designated sandbox directory, providing a clear security boundary enforcement mechanism.

**Question 7:** Why does the server implement file size limits?  

A) To save disk space  
B) To prevent denial of service attacks ‚úÖ  
C) To improve search performance  
D) To maintain file quality  

**Explanation:** File size limits prevent attackers from uploading extremely large files that could exhaust server memory or disk space, causing denial of service attacks.

**Question 8:** What approach does the server use for file type restrictions?  

A) Blacklist dangerous extensions  
B) Whitelist safe extensions ‚úÖ  
C) Allow all extensions  
D) Check file signatures only  

**Explanation:** The server uses a whitelist approach, only allowing predefined safe file extensions, which is more secure than blacklisting dangerous extensions that can be easily circumvented.

**Question 9:** How does the search_files tool prevent performance issues?  

A) By caching all file content  
B) By limiting maximum results returned ‚úÖ  
C) By using external search engines  
D) By compressing search results  

**Explanation:** The search tool implements result limits to prevent performance degradation when searching through large file sets, ensuring consistent response times.

**Question 10:** What is the primary benefit of using `aiofiles` for file operations?  

A) Non-blocking file I/O operations ‚úÖ  
B) Better error handling  
C) Faster disk access  
D) Automatic file compression  

**Explanation:** `aiofiles` provides asynchronous file operations that don't block the event loop, allowing the server to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.
