Enterprise MCP agent deployments require sophisticated patterns for production reliability, including circuit breakers, connection pooling, security controls, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Advanced Production Patterns

### Pattern 1: Circuit Breaker for MCP Server Resilience

Enterprise agents must handle partial system failures gracefully. The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures when MCP servers become unavailable.

```python
# utils/circuit_breaker.py - Essential imports for fault tolerance
import asyncio
import time
from enum import Enum
from typing import Dict, Any, Callable, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Circuit breaker implementation requires precise timing control and async operation handling. The `asyncio` module provides timeout functionality crucial for preventing hanging operations, while `time` enables recovery timeout calculations. These imports establish the foundation for implementing the **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - a fundamental enterprise resilience pattern.

```python
class CircuitState(Enum):
    CLOSED = "closed"      # Normal operation
    OPEN = "open"          # Failure state - reject requests
    HALF_OPEN = "half_open" # Testing if service recovered
```

The three-state model implements the classic circuit breaker pattern. **CLOSED** state allows normal operations with failure monitoring. **OPEN** state blocks all requests to protect failing services and prevent cascading failures. **HALF_OPEN** state carefully tests service recovery by allowing limited traffic. This state machine prevents both overwhelming failing services and missing service recovery.

```python
@dataclass
class CircuitBreakerConfig:
    failure_threshold: int = 5      # Failures before opening
    recovery_timeout: int = 60      # Seconds before trying again
    success_threshold: int = 3      # Successes needed to close
    timeout: int = 30              # Request timeout
```

Configuration parameters balance **fault detection speed** with **stability**. The failure threshold of 5 prevents opening on transient issues while catching persistent problems quickly. 60-second recovery timeout allows sufficient time for service restoration without excessive delays. Success threshold of 3 ensures genuine recovery before resuming full traffic flow.

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    """Circuit breaker for MCP server calls with enterprise reliability."""

    def __init__(self, name: str, config: CircuitBreakerConfig):
        self.name = name
        self.config = config
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.success_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = 0
```

Circuit breaker initialization establishes the **failure tracking state**. Starting in CLOSED state assumes services are healthy until proven otherwise. The counters track consecutive failures and successes, while `last_failure_time` enables recovery timeout calculations. Named circuit breakers enable monitoring multiple services independently.

```python
        self.metrics = {
            "total_requests": 0,
            "successful_requests": 0,
            "failed_requests": 0,
            "circuit_opens": 0
        }
```

Comprehensive metrics enable **operational visibility** into circuit breaker behavior. Total requests show traffic volume, success/failure ratios indicate service health, and circuit opens count helps identify unstable services. These metrics integrate with enterprise monitoring systems for alerting and capacity planning.

```python
    async def call(self, func: Callable, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """Execute function with circuit breaker protection."""
        self.metrics["total_requests"] += 1

        if self.state == CircuitState.OPEN:
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.config.recovery_timeout:
                self.state = CircuitState.HALF_OPEN
                self.success_count = 0
                logger.info(f"Circuit breaker {self.name} entering HALF_OPEN state")
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError(f"Circuit breaker {self.name} is OPEN")
```

The call method implements the **core circuit breaker logic**. Request counting provides traffic metrics. OPEN state handling either rejects requests immediately (protecting failing services) or transitions to HALF_OPEN after the recovery timeout. This automatic transition enables **self-healing behavior** without manual intervention.

```python
        try:
            # Execute with timeout
            result = await asyncio.wait_for(
                func(*args, **kwargs),
                timeout=self.config.timeout
            )

            await self._on_success()
            return result

        except Exception as e:
            await self._on_failure()
            raise e
```

Operation execution includes **timeout protection** to prevent hanging on unresponsive services. Success and failure handlers update circuit breaker state based on results. Re-raising exceptions preserves error context for calling code while still tracking the failure. This approach implements **transparent fault tolerance** - the circuit breaker is invisible when services are healthy.

```python
    async def _on_success(self):
        """Handle successful operation."""
        self.metrics["successful_requests"] += 1

        if self.state == CircuitState.HALF_OPEN:
            self.success_count += 1
            if self.success_count >= self.config.success_threshold:
                self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
                self.failure_count = 0
                logger.info(f"Circuit breaker {self.name} CLOSED - service recovered")
        else:
            self.failure_count = 0  # Reset failure count on success
```

Success handling implements **recovery verification**. In HALF_OPEN state, consecutive successes prove service recovery before transitioning to CLOSED. In CLOSED state, any success resets failure counters, preventing circuit opening due to old failures. This logic ensures the circuit breaker only opens for **current, persistent failures**.

```python
    async def _on_failure(self):
        """Handle failed operation."""
        self.metrics["failed_requests"] += 1
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.last_failure_time = time.time()

        if (self.state == CircuitState.CLOSED and
            self.failure_count >= self.config.failure_threshold):
            self.state = CircuitState.OPEN
            self.metrics["circuit_opens"] += 1
            logger.error(f"Circuit breaker {self.name} OPENED - service failing")

        elif self.state == CircuitState.HALF_OPEN:
            self.state = CircuitState.OPEN
            logger.warning(f"Circuit breaker {self.name} back to OPEN - service still failing")
```

Failure handling tracks consecutive failures and timestamps for recovery timeout calculations. CLOSED state transitions to OPEN when failure threshold is exceeded, implementing **fail-fast behavior**. HALF_OPEN failures immediately return to OPEN, indicating the service hasn't recovered. This prevents **partial recovery oscillation** that could overwhelm struggling services.

```python
class CircuitBreakerOpenError(Exception):
    """Raised when circuit breaker is open."""
    pass
```

The custom exception enables **explicit fault handling** - calling code can distinguish between circuit breaker protection and actual service failures. This allows applications to implement fallback strategies (cached responses, default values) when services are temporarily unavailable due to circuit breaker protection.

### Pattern 2: Enhanced MCP Manager with Connection Pooling

Production deployments require efficient resource management and connection pooling to handle high concurrency.

```python
# utils/enterprise_mcp_manager.py - Essential imports for enterprise patterns
import asyncio
import time
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from langchain_mcp_adapters import MCPAdapter
from config import Config, MCPServerConfig
from .circuit_breaker import CircuitBreaker, CircuitBreakerConfig

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

This import section establishes the foundation for enterprise MCP management. The `asynccontextmanager` is crucial for resource lifecycle management - it ensures connections are properly returned to the pool even if exceptions occur. The `MCPAdapter` comes from LangChain's MCP integration, providing the core interface for communicating with MCP servers in enterprise environments.

```python
class ConnectionPool:
    """Manages a pool of MCP adapter connections for high concurrency."""

    def __init__(self, server_config: MCPServerConfig, pool_size: int = 5):
        self.server_config = server_config
        self.pool_size = pool_size
        self.available_connections: asyncio.Queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=pool_size)
        self.total_connections = 0
```

The ConnectionPool class implements the **object pool pattern** - a fundamental enterprise pattern for managing expensive resources. Here we use an `asyncio.Queue` with a maximum size to control concurrency. In production environments, creating MCP connections has significant overhead (process spawning, IPC setup), so pooling dramatically improves performance under load. The queue acts as a bounded buffer, preventing resource exhaustion.

```python
        self.metrics = {
            "connections_created": 0,
            "connections_reused": 0,
            "pool_exhausted_count": 0
        }

    async def initialize(self):
        """Pre-populate connection pool."""
        for _ in range(self.pool_size):
            adapter = await self._create_connection()
            if adapter:
                await self.available_connections.put(adapter)
```

Metrics collection is essential for enterprise observability - these counters help operations teams understand connection pool efficiency and identify scaling needs. The initialization method implements **warm-up**: pre-creating connections during startup rather than on-demand. This eliminates cold-start latency for the first users, a critical pattern for enterprise SLAs.

```python
    async def _create_connection(self) -> Optional[MCPAdapter]:
        """Create a new MCP adapter connection."""
        try:
            adapter = MCPAdapter(
                command=self.server_config.command,
                args=self.server_config.args,
                timeout=self.server_config.timeout
            )
            await adapter.start()
            self.total_connections += 1
            self.metrics["connections_created"] += 1
            return adapter
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to create connection for {self.server_config.name}: {e}")
            return None
```

Connection creation handles the complex process of spawning MCP server processes and establishing communication channels. The timeout configuration is crucial for enterprise deployments - it prevents hanging connections from consuming resources indefinitely. Notice the defensive programming: returning `None` on failure rather than raising exceptions, allowing the system to degrade gracefully when individual connections fail.

```python
    @asynccontextmanager
    async def get_connection(self):
        """Get connection from pool with automatic return."""
        adapter = None
        try:
            # Try to get existing connection
            try:
                adapter = self.available_connections.get_nowait()
                self.metrics["connections_reused"] += 1
            except asyncio.QueueEmpty:
                # Pool exhausted, create new connection
                self.metrics["pool_exhausted_count"] += 1
                adapter = await self._create_connection()
                if not adapter:
                    raise ConnectionError(f"Failed to create connection for {self.server_config.name}")
```

The context manager pattern ensures **resource safety** - connections are automatically returned even if exceptions occur during use. The two-tier approach (reuse existing, then create new) implements **elastic scaling**: the pool can temporarily exceed its base size during traffic spikes, then contract back during quiet periods. Pool exhaustion metrics help capacity planning.

```python
            yield adapter

        finally:
            # Return connection to pool if still valid
            if adapter:
                try:
                    self.available_connections.put_nowait(adapter)
                except asyncio.QueueFull:
                    # Pool full, close excess connection
                    await adapter.stop()
                    self.total_connections -= 1
```

The `finally` block implements the **cleanup guarantee** - connections are always returned to the pool or properly closed. When the pool is full (during traffic spike recovery), excess connections are terminated rather than leaked. This prevents resource accumulation and ensures the system returns to its steady-state resource usage.

```python
class EnterpriseMCPManager:
    """Production-grade MCP server manager with advanced patterns."""

    def __init__(self, server_configs: List[MCPServerConfig]):
        self.server_configs = {config.name: config for config in server_configs}
        self.connection_pools: Dict[str, ConnectionPool] = {}
        self.circuit_breakers: Dict[str, CircuitBreaker] = {}
        self.health_status: Dict[str, bool] = {}
```

The EnterpriseMCPManager orchestrates multiple enterprise patterns simultaneously. It maintains separate connection pools per MCP server (horizontal scaling), individual circuit breakers for fault isolation, and health status tracking for operations dashboards. This design enables **independent failure domains** - problems with one MCP server don't affect others.

```python
        self.metrics = {
            "total_requests": 0,
            "successful_requests": 0,
            "failed_requests": 0,
            "average_response_time": 0.0
        }
        self._monitoring_task: Optional[asyncio.Task] = None
```

Global metrics provide system-wide visibility crucial for enterprise monitoring. The average response time uses a rolling calculation to provide real-time performance insights. The monitoring task reference allows for graceful shutdown - a critical requirement for enterprise applications that need clean restarts during maintenance windows.

```python
    async def initialize(self):
        """Initialize all connection pools and circuit breakers."""
        for name, config in self.server_configs.items():
            # Create connection pool
            pool = ConnectionPool(config, pool_size=5)
            await pool.initialize()
            self.connection_pools[name] = pool
```

Initialization follows the **fail-fast principle** - all critical resources are established during startup rather than on first use. This allows operators to detect configuration issues immediately rather than discovering them when users attempt operations. The sequential initialization ensures each pool is fully ready before proceeding to the next.

```python
            # Create circuit breaker
            cb_config = CircuitBreakerConfig(
                failure_threshold=5,
                recovery_timeout=60,
                success_threshold=3,
                timeout=config.timeout
            )
            self.circuit_breakers[name] = CircuitBreaker(name, cb_config)

            self.health_status[name] = True
            logger.info(f"Initialized enterprise MCP manager for {name}")
```

Circuit breaker configuration balances **fault tolerance** with **recovery speed**. A threshold of 5 failures prevents flapping on transient issues, while 60-second recovery timeout allows sufficient time for service restoration. The 3-success requirement ensures the service is genuinely recovered before resuming full traffic. These parameters are tuned for typical enterprise service characteristics.

```python
        # Start monitoring task
        self._monitoring_task = asyncio.create_task(self._monitoring_loop())

    async def call_tool(self, server_name: str, tool_name: str, args: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
        """Call tool with enterprise patterns: pooling, circuit breaker, metrics."""
        start_time = time.time()
        self.metrics["total_requests"] += 1

        if server_name not in self.connection_pools:
            raise ValueError(f"Server {server_name} not configured")
```

The monitoring loop provides **active health checking** - continuously verifying service availability rather than waiting for user-facing failures. Request timing begins immediately to capture all overhead, including pool acquisition time. Input validation prevents cryptic failures downstream when invalid server names are used.

```python
        pool = self.connection_pools[server_name]
        circuit_breaker = self.circuit_breakers[server_name]

        try:
            async def _call_with_pool():
                async with pool.get_connection() as adapter:
                    return await adapter.call_tool(tool_name, args)

            # Execute with circuit breaker protection
            result = await circuit_breaker.call(_call_with_pool)
```

This demonstrates **pattern composition** - the circuit breaker wraps the connection pool operation, providing multiple layers of protection. The inner function encapsulates the pool usage pattern, while the circuit breaker provides fault tolerance. This layered approach is fundamental to enterprise resilience architecture.

```python
            # Update metrics
            response_time = time.time() - start_time
            self.metrics["successful_requests"] += 1
            self._update_average_response_time(response_time)

            return result

        except Exception as e:
            self.metrics["failed_requests"] += 1
            self.health_status[server_name] = False
            logger.error(f"Tool call failed for {server_name}.{tool_name}: {e}")
            raise
```

Metrics are updated in both success and failure paths to ensure complete observability. Setting health status to `False` triggers alerting systems and may influence load balancing decisions in multi-region deployments. The exception is re-raised to preserve the original error context for calling code, following the **transparency principle**.

```python
    def _update_average_response_time(self, response_time: float):
        """Update rolling average response time."""
        current_avg = self.metrics["average_response_time"]
        total_requests = self.metrics["successful_requests"]

        # Calculate rolling average
        self.metrics["average_response_time"] = (
            (current_avg * (total_requests - 1) + response_time) / total_requests
        )
```

The rolling average calculation provides **real-time performance visibility** without storing historical data points. This approach scales to high-traffic environments where storing individual response times would consume excessive memory. The calculation weights recent performance more heavily as the denominator grows, providing insight into current system behavior.

```python
    async def _monitoring_loop(self):
        """Continuous monitoring and health checks."""
        while True:
            try:
                for name in self.server_configs.keys():
                    await self._health_check(name)
                await asyncio.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds
            except asyncio.CancelledError:
                break
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Monitoring loop error: {e}")
                await asyncio.sleep(5)
```

The monitoring loop implements **proactive health checking** with graceful error handling. The 30-second interval balances freshness with resource consumption. Catching `CancelledError` specifically allows for clean shutdown, while generic exception handling ensures monitoring continues even if individual health checks fail. The shorter sleep on errors enables faster recovery from transient monitoring issues.

```python
    async def _health_check(self, server_name: str):
        """Perform health check on server."""
        try:
            # Simple health check by listing tools
            pool = self.connection_pools[server_name]
            async with pool.get_connection() as adapter:
                await adapter.list_tools()

            self.health_status[server_name] = True

        except Exception as e:
            self.health_status[server_name] = False
            logger.warning(f"Health check failed for {server_name}: {e}")
```

Health checks use a lightweight operation (`list_tools`) that exercises the complete communication path without side effects. This approach detects connection, process, and protocol issues while avoiding expensive operations during monitoring. The binary health status feeds into alerting systems and operational dashboards.

```python
    def get_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get comprehensive metrics for monitoring."""
        server_metrics = {}
        for name, cb in self.circuit_breakers.items():
            server_metrics[name] = {
                "circuit_breaker_state": cb.state.value,
                "circuit_breaker_metrics": cb.metrics,
                "connection_pool_metrics": self.connection_pools[name].metrics,
                "health_status": self.health_status[name]
            }

        return {
            "global_metrics": self.metrics,
            "server_metrics": server_metrics
        }
```

The metrics endpoint provides **hierarchical observability** - global system metrics plus per-server details. This structure supports both high-level dashboard views and detailed troubleshooting. Including circuit breaker states helps operators understand why certain servers might be unavailable, enabling informed intervention decisions.

```python
    async def cleanup(self):
        """Clean up resources."""
        if self._monitoring_task:
            self._monitoring_task.cancel()
            try:
                await self._monitoring_task
            except asyncio.CancelledError:
                pass

        # Close all connections
        for pool in self.connection_pools.values():
            while pool.total_connections > 0:
                try:
                    adapter = pool.available_connections.get_nowait()
                    await adapter.stop()
                    pool.total_connections -= 1
                except asyncio.QueueEmpty:
                    break
```

Proper cleanup is essential for enterprise applications that need clean restarts during maintenance. The monitoring task is cancelled gracefully, and all pooled connections are explicitly closed to prevent process leaks. This pattern ensures the system can restart cleanly without leaving zombie processes or locked resources.

### Pattern 3: Enterprise Security and Access Control

Production agents require sophisticated access control and audit logging.

```python
# security/enterprise_auth.py - Enterprise security imports
import jwt
import time
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Set
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Enterprise security requires careful handling of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. The `jwt` library provides cryptographically secure token validation essential for enterprise environments. Time-based expiration checking prevents stale credentials from being used, while logging ensures all security events are tracked for compliance.

```python
class Permission(Enum):
    READ_WEATHER = "weather:read"
    READ_FILES = "files:read"
    WRITE_FILES = "files:write"
    QUERY_DATABASE = "database:query"
    MODIFY_DATABASE = "database:modify"
    ADMIN_TOOLS = "admin:*"
```

Permission enumeration implements **principle of least privilege** - defining granular access rights that map to specific enterprise operations. The string values follow a namespace:action pattern enabling flexible authorization policies. The wildcard `admin:*` provides superuser access while maintaining auditability. This structure supports enterprise compliance requirements for access control documentation.

```python
@dataclass
class UserContext:
    user_id: str
    roles: Set[str]
    permissions: Set[Permission]
    session_id: str
    expires_at: float
    organization_id: str
```

UserContext encapsulates all security-relevant user information in a single immutable structure. Including `organization_id` enables **multi-tenant security** - ensuring users can only access resources within their organization. The `expires_at` timestamp enforces **session lifetime limits**, while `session_id` enables session tracking and revocation capabilities essential for enterprise security.

```python
class EnterpriseAuthenticator:
    """Enterprise authentication and authorization for MCP agents."""

    def __init__(self, jwt_secret: str, default_permissions: Dict[str, List[Permission]]):
        self.jwt_secret = jwt_secret
        self.default_permissions = default_permissions
        self.active_sessions: Dict[str, UserContext] = {}
        self.audit_log: List[Dict] = []
```

The authenticator maintains role-based access control (RBAC) through `default_permissions` mapping. The `jwt_secret` must be cryptographically secure and shared across service instances for token validation. Active session tracking enables real-time access control and supports security features like concurrent session limits and forced logouts.

```python
    def authenticate_token(self, token: str) -> Optional[UserContext]:
        """Authenticate JWT token and return user context."""
        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(token, self.jwt_secret, algorithms=["HS256"])

            user_id = payload.get("user_id")
            roles = set(payload.get("roles", []))
            session_id = payload.get("session_id")
            expires_at = payload.get("exp", 0)
            organization_id = payload.get("org_id")
```

JWT token validation uses HMAC-SHA256 algorithm providing cryptographic integrity - ensuring tokens cannot be forged without the secret key. Extracting claims from the payload establishes user identity and roles. The use of `get()` with defaults prevents KeyError exceptions when tokens have missing fields, implementing **defensive programming** for security-critical code.

```python
            if time.time() > expires_at:
                self._audit("TOKEN_EXPIRED", {"user_id": user_id})
                return None

            # Calculate permissions from roles
            permissions = set()
            for role in roles:
                permissions.update(self.default_permissions.get(role, []))
```

Expiration checking prevents **replay attacks** using old credentials. All security events including expired tokens are audited for forensic analysis. Permission calculation implements **role-based access control** - users inherit all permissions from their assigned roles. This approach scales better than direct permission assignment in large organizations.

```python
            user_context = UserContext(
                user_id=user_id,
                roles=roles,
                permissions=permissions,
                session_id=session_id,
                expires_at=expires_at,
                organization_id=organization_id
            )

            self.active_sessions[session_id] = user_context
            self._audit("USER_AUTHENTICATED", {"user_id": user_id, "roles": list(roles)})

            return user_context
```

Successful authentication creates a UserContext with computed permissions, enabling **stateless authorization** - subsequent requests don't need to recalculate permissions. Session tracking enables advanced features like concurrent session limits and administrative logouts. Authentication events are audited with user and role information for compliance reporting.

```python
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError as e:
            self._audit("INVALID_TOKEN", {"error": str(e)})
            return None
```

Invalid token handling implements **security-first design** - any JWT validation failure results in authentication denial and audit logging. This catches forged tokens, signature mismatches, and malformed tokens. The specific error is logged for security analysis while clients receive a simple rejection.

```python
    def authorize_tool_access(self, user_context: UserContext, server_name: str, tool_name: str) -> bool:
        """Check if user has permission to access specific tool."""
        required_permission = self._get_required_permission(server_name, tool_name)

        if required_permission in user_context.permissions:
            self._audit("TOOL_ACCESS_GRANTED", {
                "user_id": user_context.user_id,
                "server": server_name,
                "tool": tool_name
            })
            return True
```

Authorization implements **fine-grained access control** at the MCP tool level. Every tool access requires explicit permission checking, preventing privilege escalation. Successful access is audited with full context (user, server, tool) enabling detailed access analysis and supporting compliance requirements for data access logging.

```python
        self._audit("TOOL_ACCESS_DENIED", {
            "user_id": user_context.user_id,
            "server": server_name,
            "tool": tool_name,
            "required_permission": required_permission.value
        })
        return False
```

Access denial auditing captures both the attempt and the required permission, enabling security analysis and helping administrators understand why access was denied. This information supports **zero-trust security** - every access attempt is logged and can be analyzed for suspicious patterns.

```python
    def _get_required_permission(self, server_name: str, tool_name: str) -> Permission:
        """Map server/tool combinations to required permissions."""
        permission_map = {
            ("weather", "get_current_weather"): Permission.READ_WEATHER,
            ("weather", "get_forecast"): Permission.READ_WEATHER,
            ("filesystem", "read_file"): Permission.READ_FILES,
            ("filesystem", "write_file"): Permission.WRITE_FILES,
            ("filesystem", "list_files"): Permission.READ_FILES,
            ("database", "query"): Permission.QUERY_DATABASE,
            ("database", "insert"): Permission.MODIFY_DATABASE,
            ("database", "update"): Permission.MODIFY_DATABASE,
        }

        return permission_map.get((server_name, tool_name), Permission.ADMIN_TOOLS)
```

Permission mapping implements **declarative security policy** - clearly defining what permission each MCP tool requires. The tuple-based mapping allows precise control over server-tool combinations. Defaulting to `ADMIN_TOOLS` for unmapped operations implements **secure by default** - unknown operations require maximum privileges, forcing explicit permission grants.

```python
    def _audit(self, action: str, details: Dict):
        """Log security events for audit trail."""
        audit_entry = {
            "timestamp": time.time(),
            "action": action,
            "details": details
        }

        self.audit_log.append(audit_entry)
        logger.info(f"SECURITY_AUDIT: {action} - {details}")

        # Keep only last 1000 entries in memory
        if len(self.audit_log) > 1000:
            self.audit_log = self.audit_log[-1000:]
```

Comprehensive audit logging captures all security events with timestamps and contextual details. The structured format enables automated analysis and compliance reporting. Memory bounds prevent unbounded growth while retaining sufficient history for security analysis. The logging integration ensures events reach centralized security monitoring systems.

```python
    def get_audit_log(self, user_id: Optional[str] = None, limit: int = 100) -> List[Dict]:
        """Retrieve audit log entries."""
        if user_id:
            filtered_log = [
                entry for entry in self.audit_log
                if entry["details"].get("user_id") == user_id
            ]
        else:
            filtered_log = self.audit_log

        return filtered_log[-limit:]
```

Audit log retrieval supports both user-specific and system-wide analysis. Filtering by user enables **individual access review** - examining all actions by a specific user for security investigations. The limit parameter prevents large result sets while the reverse slice returns the most recent entries, supporting both real-time monitoring and historical analysis.

### Pattern 4: Performance Monitoring and Observability

Enterprise deployments require comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities.

```python
# monitoring/enterprise_monitoring.py - Comprehensive monitoring imports
import time
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict
from collections import defaultdict, deque
import statistics
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Enterprise monitoring requires sophisticated data structures and statistical analysis. The `deque` provides efficient circular buffering for metrics storage, while `defaultdict` simplifies grouping operations. The `statistics` module enables percentile calculations essential for SLA monitoring. These imports establish the foundation for production-grade observability.

```python
@dataclass
class PerformanceMetrics:
    timestamp: float
    server_name: str
    tool_name: str
    response_time: float
    success: bool
    error_type: Optional[str] = None
    user_id: Optional[str] = None
```

The PerformanceMetrics dataclass captures the essential dimensions for enterprise monitoring: **temporal** (when), **spatial** (which server), **functional** (what operation), **performance** (how fast), and **quality** (success/failure). Including `user_id` enables per-tenant analysis in multi-tenant environments. This structure supports both real-time alerting and historical trend analysis.

```python
class PerformanceTracker:
    """Enterprise-grade performance monitoring for MCP agents."""

    def __init__(self, retention_hours: int = 24):
        self.retention_hours = retention_hours
        self.metrics: deque = deque(maxlen=10000)  # Keep last 10k metrics
        self.alert_thresholds = {
            "response_time_p95": 5.0,      # 95th percentile response time
            "error_rate": 0.05,            # 5% error rate
            "availability": 0.99           # 99% availability
        }
        self.alerts: List[Dict] = []
```

The bounded deque implements **fixed-memory monitoring** - crucial for long-running enterprise services. The 10,000 metric limit prevents memory growth while providing sufficient data for statistical analysis. Alert thresholds follow enterprise SLA standards: P95 response time captures tail latency that affects user experience, 5% error rate allows for transient issues without false alarms, and 99% availability maps to "two nines" uptime requirements.

```python
    def record_metric(self, metric: PerformanceMetrics):
        """Record a performance metric."""
        self.metrics.append(metric)
        self._check_alerts()
```

Metric recording triggers immediate alert evaluation - implementing **real-time monitoring**. This approach ensures rapid detection of performance degradation, critical for enterprise environments where service level objectives must be maintained. The automatic alert checking eliminates the need for separate monitoring processes.

```python
    def get_server_stats(self, server_name: str, hours: int = 1) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get comprehensive statistics for a server."""
        cutoff_time = time.time() - (hours * 3600)
        server_metrics = [
            m for m in self.metrics
            if m.server_name == server_name and m.timestamp >= cutoff_time
        ]

        if not server_metrics:
            return {"error": "No metrics found for server"}
```

Time-based filtering provides **sliding window analysis** - essential for understanding recent performance trends without being skewed by historical issues. The hour-based parameterization allows operators to adjust the analysis timeframe based on their needs: short windows for incident response, longer windows for capacity planning.

```python
        successful_metrics = [m for m in server_metrics if m.success]
        failed_metrics = [m for m in server_metrics if not m.success]

        response_times = [m.response_time for m in successful_metrics]

        stats = {
            "total_requests": len(server_metrics),
            "successful_requests": len(successful_metrics),
            "failed_requests": len(failed_metrics),
            "error_rate": len(failed_metrics) / len(server_metrics) if server_metrics else 0,
            "availability": len(successful_metrics) / len(server_metrics) if server_metrics else 0,
        }
```

Separating successful and failed metrics enables **quality-based analysis**. Response times are calculated only from successful operations to avoid skewing performance metrics with timeout failures. The error rate and availability calculations provide the **Golden Signals** of monitoring - key indicators that drive operational decisions in enterprise environments.

```python
        if response_times:
            stats.update({
                "avg_response_time": statistics.mean(response_times),
                "min_response_time": min(response_times),
                "max_response_time": max(response_times),
                "p50_response_time": statistics.median(response_times),
                "p95_response_time": self._percentile(response_times, 0.95),
                "p99_response_time": self._percentile(response_times, 0.99),
            })
```

Comprehensive response time statistics provide different operational insights: **mean** shows overall system performance, **median** reveals typical user experience, **P95/P99** expose tail latency affecting a subset of users. These percentiles are crucial for enterprise SLAs - most systems can handle average performance but struggle with outliers that create poor user experiences.

```python
        # Error breakdown
        error_counts = defaultdict(int)
        for metric in failed_metrics:
            error_counts[metric.error_type or "unknown"] += 1
        stats["error_breakdown"] = dict(error_counts)

        return stats
```

Error categorization enables **root cause analysis** - distinguishing between timeout errors, connection failures, authentication issues, and application errors. This breakdown helps operations teams prioritize fixes: network issues require infrastructure attention, while application errors need development team involvement.

```python
    def get_tool_stats(self, tool_name: str, hours: int = 1) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get statistics for a specific tool across all servers."""
        cutoff_time = time.time() - (hours * 3600)
        tool_metrics = [
            m for m in self.metrics
            if m.tool_name == tool_name and m.timestamp >= cutoff_time
        ]

        if not tool_metrics:
            return {"error": "No metrics found for tool"}
```

Tool-centric analysis supports **feature-level monitoring** - understanding how specific MCP tools perform across different servers. This view helps identify whether performance issues are systemic (affecting all tools) or specific to certain functionality, guiding troubleshooting efforts in complex enterprise deployments.

```python
        # Group by server
        server_stats = defaultdict(list)
        for metric in tool_metrics:
            server_stats[metric.server_name].append(metric)

        result = {
            "total_requests": len(tool_metrics),
            "servers_used": list(server_stats.keys()),
            "per_server_stats": {}
        }

        for server, metrics in server_stats.items():
            successful = [m for m in metrics if m.success]
            result["per_server_stats"][server] = {
                "requests": len(metrics),
                "success_rate": len(successful) / len(metrics),
                "avg_response_time": statistics.mean([m.response_time for m in successful]) if successful else 0
            }
```

Server grouping reveals **load distribution patterns** and helps identify performance outliers. If one server shows consistently poor performance for a specific tool, it may indicate configuration issues, resource constraints, or network problems affecting that server specifically.

```python
    def _percentile(self, data: List[float], percentile: float) -> float:
        """Calculate percentile of data."""
        if not data:
            return 0.0
        sorted_data = sorted(data)
        index = int(percentile * len(sorted_data))
        return sorted_data[min(index, len(sorted_data) - 1)]
```

Custom percentile calculation provides precise control over statistical analysis. While libraries exist for this, the simple implementation avoids external dependencies and ensures consistent behavior across environments. The boundary check prevents index errors with small datasets.

```python
    def _check_alerts(self):
        """Check for alert conditions."""
        # Only check alerts every 100 metrics to avoid overhead
        if len(self.metrics) % 100 != 0:
            return

        # Check last hour of data
        recent_stats = self.get_server_stats("all", hours=1)
        if "error" in recent_stats:
            return
```

Throttled alert checking implements **computational efficiency** - running expensive statistical calculations every 100 metrics rather than every metric. This reduces CPU overhead while maintaining reasonable alert latency. The one-hour analysis window provides sufficient data for reliable trend detection.

```python
        # Check response time P95
        if recent_stats.get("p95_response_time", 0) > self.alert_thresholds["response_time_p95"]:
            self._trigger_alert("HIGH_RESPONSE_TIME", {
                "p95_response_time": recent_stats["p95_response_time"],
                "threshold": self.alert_thresholds["response_time_p95"]
            })

        # Check error rate
        if recent_stats.get("error_rate", 0) > self.alert_thresholds["error_rate"]:
            self._trigger_alert("HIGH_ERROR_RATE", {
                "error_rate": recent_stats["error_rate"],
                "threshold": self.alert_thresholds["error_rate"]
            })
```

Multiple alert conditions monitor the **Golden Signals** - latency, errors, and availability. Each alert includes both current value and threshold for context. This information helps operators quickly assess severity and understand how far metrics have deviated from acceptable ranges.

```python
        # Check availability
        if recent_stats.get("availability", 1) < self.alert_thresholds["availability"]:
            self._trigger_alert("LOW_AVAILABILITY", {
                "availability": recent_stats["availability"],
                "threshold": self.alert_thresholds["availability"]
            })
```

Availability monitoring detects systemic failures that might not trigger individual error rate alerts. The default value of 1 (100%) ensures that missing availability data doesn't trigger false alerts while still catching genuine availability issues.

```python
    def _trigger_alert(self, alert_type: str, details: Dict):
        """Trigger an alert."""
        alert = {
            "timestamp": time.time(),
            "type": alert_type,
            "details": details,
            "resolved": False
        }

        self.alerts.append(alert)
        logger.warning(f"ALERT: {alert_type} - {details}")

        # Keep only last 100 alerts
        if len(self.alerts) > 100:
            self.alerts = self.alerts[-100:]
```

Alert structures capture essential metadata for incident management: timestamp for correlation, type for categorization, details for context, and resolution status for tracking. The bounded alert history prevents memory growth while maintaining recent alert context for troubleshooting.

```python
    def get_health_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get overall system health status."""
        recent_time = time.time() - 300  # Last 5 minutes
        recent_metrics = [m for m in self.metrics if m.timestamp >= recent_time]

        if not recent_metrics:
            return {"status": "UNKNOWN", "reason": "No recent metrics"}

        error_rate = len([m for m in recent_metrics if not m.success]) / len(recent_metrics)
        avg_response_time = statistics.mean([m.response_time for m in recent_metrics if m.success])

        if error_rate > 0.1:  # 10% error rate
            return {"status": "CRITICAL", "reason": "High error rate", "error_rate": error_rate}
        elif error_rate > 0.05:  # 5% error rate
            return {"status": "WARNING", "reason": "Elevated error rate", "error_rate": error_rate}
        elif avg_response_time > 3.0:  # 3 second average
            return {"status": "WARNING", "reason": "Slow response times", "avg_response_time": avg_response_time}
        else:
            return {"status": "HEALTHY", "error_rate": error_rate, "avg_response_time": avg_response_time}
```

The health status endpoint provides **traffic light monitoring** - a simple red/yellow/green status that operations teams can quickly interpret. The 5-minute window focuses on very recent performance, suitable for immediate operational decisions. Tiered thresholds distinguish between warning conditions (requiring attention) and critical conditions (requiring immediate action).
