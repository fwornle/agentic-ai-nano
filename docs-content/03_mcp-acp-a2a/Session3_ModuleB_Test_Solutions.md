# Session 3 - Module B: Advanced Workflows - Test Solutions

**Question 1:** What is the primary advantage of parallel processing in workflows?  

A) Simplified code structure  
B) Reduced resource usage  
C) Faster overall execution time ✅  
D) Better error handling  

**Explanation:** Parallel processing allows independent operations to run simultaneously, significantly reducing total execution time. Instead of waiting for each operation to complete sequentially, multiple tasks can be processed concurrently, improving overall workflow performance.

**Question 2:** In conditional workflow routing, what determines the execution path?  

A) Random selection  
B) Runtime conditions and content analysis ✅  
C) User preferences  
D) System load  

**Explanation:** Conditional workflow routing uses runtime analysis of query content, keywords, urgency patterns, and other contextual factors to dynamically determine the optimal execution path. This enables intelligent adaptation to different types of requests.

**Question 3:** What is the purpose of compensation actions in workflow patterns?  

A) Improve performance  
B) Undo completed steps when later steps fail ✅  
C) Reduce memory usage  
D) Simplify configuration  

**Explanation:** Compensation actions provide a way to undo or reverse completed workflow steps when later steps fail, maintaining data consistency and system integrity. They implement the compensation pattern for distributed transaction management.

---

**Question 4:** How does the parallel workflow handle partial failures?  

A) Stops all processing immediately  
B) Continues with successful results and reports failures ✅  
C) Retries all operations  
D) Ignores failed operations  

**Explanation:** The parallel workflow is designed to be resilient, continuing execution with successful results while properly tracking and reporting failures. This allows partial completion and graceful degradation rather than total failure.

---

**Question 5:** What triggers escalation in the conditional workflow router?  

A) High system load  
B) Customer tier, priority level, or escalation keywords ✅  
C) Time of day  
D) Random intervals  

**Explanation:** Escalation is triggered by multiple factors including customer tier (premium customers), priority level (critical/high), or detection of escalation keywords in the query content (complaints, frustration, etc.).

---

**Question 6:** In the compensation pattern, in what order are compensation actions executed?  

A) Random order  
B) Same order as original execution  
C) Reverse order of original execution ✅  
D) Priority-based order  

**Explanation:** Compensation actions are executed in reverse order of the original execution to properly unwind dependencies. This ensures that dependent operations are undone before the operations they depend on, maintaining referential integrity.

---

**Question 7:** What is the benefit of checkpoint data in advanced workflows?  

A) Performance optimization  
B) State recovery and resumption after failures ✅  
C) User experience improvement  
D) Reduced memory usage  

**Explanation:** Checkpoint data enables state recovery and workflow resumption after failures. By saving workflow state at key points, the system can recover from failures without losing all progress, improving reliability and user experience.
