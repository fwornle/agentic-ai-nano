A) Using dependency graphs and prerequisite checking ‚úÖ  
B) By alphabetical ordering  
C) Through timing delays only  
D) Through random execution  
**Correct Answer: A) Using dependency graphs and prerequisite checking**

**Explanation:** Step dependencies are managed through dependency graphs that define prerequisite relationships, ensuring steps execute in the correct order based on their interdependencies.

---

### Question 7: Resource Management
**What is the purpose of resource allocation in advanced workflows?**

A) To reduce costs  
B) To improve security  
C) To simplify configuration  
D) To prevent resource contention and ensure optimal performance ‚úÖ  
**Correct Answer: D) To prevent resource contention and ensure optimal performance**

---

### Question 8: Workflow Monitoring
**What metrics are most important for workflow observability?**

A) Only network traffic  
B) Only execution time  
C) Execution time, success rates, resource utilization, and error patterns ‚úÖ  
D) Just memory usage  
**Correct Answer: C) Execution time, success rates, resource utilization, and error patterns**

**Explanation:** Comprehensive workflow observability requires monitoring execution time, success rates, resource utilization, and error patterns to understand system behavior and identify optimization opportunities.

---

### Question 9: Loop Termination
**What mechanisms prevent infinite loops in workflow systems?**

A) Time-based termination only  
B) Manual intervention  
C) Maximum iteration limits and conditional exit criteria ‚úÖ  
D) Random termination  
**Correct Answer: C) Maximum iteration limits and conditional exit criteria**

**Explanation:** Loop termination is ensured through maximum iteration limits combined with conditional exit criteria that evaluate whether the loop's objectives have been met.

---

### Question 10: Hybrid Workflows
**What advantage do hybrid workflows provide over simple workflow patterns?**

A) Lower resource usage  
B) Faster execution  
C) Easier implementation
