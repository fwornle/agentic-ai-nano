B) Functions, Data, and Templates  
C) Tools, Resources, and Prompts ‚úÖ  
D) Commands, Files, and Scripts  
**Correct Answer: C) Tools, Resources, and Prompts**

**Explanation:** MCP servers expose three types of capabilities: Tools (functions that agents can call), Resources (data sources that agents can read), and Prompts (reusable prompt templates for common tasks).

---

### Question 4: ACP Framework
**What is the primary purpose of the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)?**

A) Cloud-based agent deployment  
B) External API management  
C) Local-first agent coordination ‚úÖ  
D) LLM model training  
**Correct Answer: C) Local-first agent coordination**

**Explanation:** ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) is designed for local-first agent coordination, enabling agents to discover and communicate within the same runtime, edge device, or local network‚Äîeven without internet connectivity.

---

### Question 5: ACP Advantages
**What is a key advantage of ACP compared to cloud-dependent agent communication?**

A) It only works with specific frameworks  
B) It requires internet connectivity  
C) It requires complex setup  
D) It enables offline agent coordination ‚úÖ  
**Correct Answer: D) It enables offline agent coordination**

**Explanation:** ACP enables agents to discover and communicate within local environments without requiring internet connectivity, making it ideal for edge deployments and offline scenarios where traditional cloud-dependent solutions would fail.

---

### Question 6: A2A Communication
**What does A2A stand for in the context of AI systems?**

A) Agent-to-API  
B) API-to-API  
C) Agent-to-Agent ‚úÖ  
D) Application-to-Application  
**Correct Answer: C) Agent-to-Agent**

**Explanation:** A2A stands for Agent-to-Agent communication, enabling direct interaction between autonomous AI agents across different systems and organizations.

---

### Question 7: A2A Benefits
**What is the primary benefit of A2A communication?**

A) Direct autonomous agent collaboration ‚úÖ  
B) Lower costs  
C) Better security  
D) Faster processing  
**Correct Answer: A) Direct autonomous agent collaboration**

**Explanation:** A2A enables autonomous agents to collaborate directly without human intervention, creating more efficient and scalable AI systems that can work together to solve complex problems.

---

### Question 8: Integration Architecture
**In a typical enterprise integration using all three protocols, which handles external data access?**

A) MCP ‚úÖ  
B) ACP  
C) All three equally  
D) A2A  
**Correct Answer: A) MCP**

**Explanation:** MCP specifically handles standardized access to external data sources, APIs, and tools, while ACP manages local agent coordination and A2A enables inter-agent communication.

---

### Question 9: MCP Transport
**Which transport methods does MCP support?**

A) HTTP only  
B) TCP only  
C) Both HTTP and WebSocket ‚úÖ  
D) WebSocket only  
**Correct Answer: C) Both HTTP and WebSocket**

**Explanation:** MCP supports multiple transport methods including HTTP for request-response patterns and WebSocket for real-time, bidirectional communication.

---

### Question 10: ACP Components
**Which of the following is NOT a core component of ACP?**

A) Agent Registry  
B) Local Discovery  
C) Cloud Dependencies ‚úÖ  
D) REST Endpoints  
**Correct Answer: C) Cloud Dependencies**

**Explanation:** ACP core components include Agent Registry (for local discovery), REST Endpoints (for communication), Local Discovery mechanisms, and Framework-agnostic interfaces. Cloud Dependencies are explicitly avoided since ACP is designed for local-first operation.

---

### Question 11: Enterprise Use Case
**Which scenario best demonstrates the power of combining MCP, ACP, and A2A?**

A) A single agent answering questions  
B) File processing only  
C) Multiple agents coordinating across departments with external data access ‚úÖ  
D) Simple API calls  
**Correct Answer: C) Multiple agents coordinating across departments with external data access**

**Explanation:** The combination shines in complex enterprise scenarios where multiple specialized agents need to coordinate (A2A), access various external systems (MCP), while being coordinated locally (ACP).

---

### Question 12: Development Strategy
**What is the recommended approach for learning these three protocols?**

A) Start with MCP, then build up to ACP and A2A ‚úÖ  
B) Learn all simultaneously  
C) Start with the most complex  
D) Start with A2A first  
**Correct Answer: A) Start with MCP, then build up to ACP and A2A**

**Explanation:** Starting with MCP provides the foundation for external integrations, then ACP for local agent coordination, and finally A2A for multi-agent communication builds knowledge progressively.

---

### Question 13: MCP Inspector Tool
**What is the primary purpose of the MCP Inspector?**

A) Performance monitoring  
B) Code debugging  
C) Security scanning  
D) Testing and validating MCP server implementations ‚úÖ  
**Correct Answer: D) Testing and validating MCP server implementations**

**Explanation:** MCP Inspector provides a graphical interface for testing MCP servers, validating tool implementations, and debugging protocol interactions before production deployment.

### Question 15: Learning Path
**What is the recommended development path for mastering these protocols?**

A) Learn all three simultaneously  
B) Start with ACP, then MCP, then A2A  
C) Start with MCP, then ACP, then A2A ‚úÖ
