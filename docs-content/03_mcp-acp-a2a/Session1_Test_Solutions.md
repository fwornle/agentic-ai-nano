# Session 1: Building Your First MCP Server - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test - Session 1

**Question 1:** What are the three core capabilities that MCP servers can expose?  

A) APIs, Databases, and Services  
B) Functions, Classes, and Modules  
C) Tools, Resources, and Prompts ‚úÖ  
D) Inputs, Outputs, and Errors  

**Explanation:** MCP servers expose three types of capabilities: Tools (executable functions that can be called), Resources (data sources that can be queried), and Prompts (reusable templates for common tasks).

**Question 2:** Which decorator is used to expose a function as an MCP tool?  

A) `@tool()`  
B) `@mcp.tool()` ‚úÖ  
C) `@server.tool()`  
D) `@expose_tool()`  

**Explanation:** The `@mcp.tool()` decorator is the FastMCP framework's way to register a function as an MCP tool that can be called by AI agents.

**Question 3:** What is the primary purpose of MCP Inspector?  

A) To deploy MCP servers to production  
B) To test, debug, and validate MCP servers ‚úÖ  
C) To monitor server performance  
D) To manage server configurations  

**Explanation:** MCP Inspector is a developer tool (like Postman for MCP) that provides an interactive interface to explore MCP server capabilities, test tools, debug issues, and validate that servers follow the protocol correctly.

**Question 4:** Which transport mechanism is commonly used for local MCP server testing?  

A) HTTP  
B) WebSocket  
C) stdio (standard input/output) ‚úÖ  
D) TCP  

**Explanation:** MCP servers communicate over stdio (standard input/output) by default for local development, which allows them to work as subprocess-based tools.

**Question 5:** Why are type hints important in MCP server functions?  

A) They improve code readability only  
B) They enable automatic schema generation for AI clients ‚úÖ  
C) They are required by Python  
D) They reduce memory usage  

**Explanation:** Type hints are used by the MCP framework to automatically generate JSON schemas that describe the tool's parameters and return values to AI clients, enabling proper validation and usage.

**Question 6:** What should MCP tools return when encountering invalid input?  

A) Raise an exception  
B) Return None  
C) Return structured error messages with helpful information ‚úÖ  
D) Log the error silently  

**Explanation:** MCP tools should return structured error messages with helpful information rather than raising exceptions, which provides better error handling for clients.

**Question 7:** How do MCP resources differ from tools?  

A) Resources are executable functions, tools are data sources  
B) Resources provide read-only data access, tools are executable functions ‚úÖ  
C) Resources are faster than tools  
D) Resources require authentication, tools do not  

**Explanation:** Resources are read-only data endpoints that provide information (like file contents or database records), while tools are executable functions that can perform actions or computations.

**Question 8:** What command is used to launch MCP Inspector?  

A) `mcp-inspector`  
B) `npm start inspector`  
C) `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` ‚úÖ  
D) `python -m mcp.inspector`  

**Explanation:** MCP Inspector can be launched using the `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` command, which runs the inspector without requiring a global installation.

**Question 9:** Which company reported 60% faster AI integration development using MCP?  

A) Microsoft  
B) Google  
C) Block Inc. ‚úÖ  
D) OpenAI  

**Explanation:** Block Inc. reported significant development speed improvements when using MCP for their AI integrations, demonstrating the protocol's real-world benefits in enterprise environments.

**Question 10:** What is the main advantage of MCP over custom API integrations?  

A) Better performance  
B) Standardized protocol with automatic schema validation ‚úÖ  
C) Lower cost  
D) Easier to learn  

**Explanation:** MCP provides a standardized protocol that includes automatic schema validation, discovery mechanisms, and consistent error handling, reducing the complexity of custom integrations.
