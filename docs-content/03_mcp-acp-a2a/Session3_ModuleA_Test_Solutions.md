# Session 3 - Module A: Enterprise Patterns - Test Solutions

## Module Assessment Solutions

**Question 1:** What is the primary purpose of the circuit breaker pattern in enterprise MCP deployments?  

A) Improve performance
B) Prevent cascading failures ✅
C) Reduce memory usage
D) Simplify configuration

**Explanation:** The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures by monitoring service health and temporarily blocking requests to failing services, allowing them time to recover while protecting the overall system stability.

---

**Question 2:** In the connection pooling pattern, what happens when the pool is exhausted?  

A) Requests are rejected
B) New connections are created temporarily ✅
C) The system waits indefinitely
D) Connections are shared unsafely

**Explanation:** When the connection pool is exhausted, the system creates new connections temporarily to handle the load. These excess connections are closed when returned, maintaining the optimal pool size while handling peak demands.

---

**Question 3:** Which authentication standard does the enterprise security pattern implement?  

A) Basic authentication
B) OAuth 2.0
C) JWT tokens ✅
D) API keys

**Explanation:** The enterprise security pattern implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, which provides secure, stateless authentication with role-based access control and audit capabilities.

---

**Question 4:** What triggers performance alerts in the monitoring system?  

A) Manual configuration only
B) Threshold violations for response time, error rate, or availability ✅
C) User complaints
D) Server restart events

**Explanation:** The monitoring system automatically triggers alerts when predefined thresholds are violated for key metrics like P95 response time, error rate percentage, or system availability, enabling proactive issue resolution.

---

**Question 5:** How does the enterprise MCP manager handle server failures?  

A) Immediate shutdown
B) Circuit breaker protection with automatic recovery testing ✅
C) Manual intervention required
D) Load balancing to other servers

**Explanation:** The enterprise MCP manager uses circuit breaker protection to detect failures and automatically test for recovery. When a service fails, the circuit breaker opens to protect the system, then periodically tests if the service has recovered.

---

**Question 6:** What is the benefit of audit logging in enterprise deployments?  

A) Performance optimization
B) Compliance and security forensics ✅
C) Debugging code issues
D) User experience improvement

**Explanation:** Audit logging provides comprehensive tracking of security events, user actions, and system access patterns, which is essential for compliance requirements and security forensics in enterprise environments.

---

**Question 7:** In the performance tracking system, what does P95 response time represent?  

A) Average response time
B) 95% of requests complete within this time ✅
C) Maximum response time
D) 95% availability percentage

**Explanation:** P95 response time means that 95% of all requests complete within this time threshold. It's a more reliable indicator of user experience than average response time, as it accounts for performance outliers.
