# Session 1: Basic RAG Implementation - From Architecture to Reality

In Session 0, you explored RAG's three-stage architecture and understood the evolution from keyword search to intelligent agentic systems. You learned about the technical challenges: poor chunking destroys context, semantic gaps make retrieval fail, and low-quality context leads to hallucinated responses.

Now comes the critical transition: transforming architectural understanding into working production systems. This is where RAG theory meets the unforgiving realities of production environments - where millisecond response times matter, where error handling determines system reliability, and where the quality of your chunking strategy directly impacts business outcomes.

## üéØüìù‚öôÔ∏è Learning Path Overview

This session offers three distinct learning paths designed to match your goals and time investment:

=== "üéØ Observer (30-45 min)"

    **Focus**: Understanding concepts and architecture
    
    **Activities**: Core RAG implementation principles, production stack requirements
    
    **Ideal for**: Decision makers, architects, overview learners

=== "üìù Participant (2-4 hours)"

    **Focus**: Guided implementation and analysis
    
    **Activities**: Build production RAG systems, implement document processing pipelines
    
    **Ideal for**: Developers, technical leads, hands-on learners

=== "‚öôÔ∏è Implementer (6-8 hours)"

    **Focus**: Complete implementation and customization
    
    **Activities**: Enterprise RAG patterns, advanced optimization, monitoring systems
    
    **Ideal for**: Senior engineers, architects, specialists
