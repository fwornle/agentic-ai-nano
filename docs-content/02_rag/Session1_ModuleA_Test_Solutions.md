# Session 1: Production RAG Patterns - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

### Question 1: Circuit Breaker Pattern

**What is the primary purpose of the circuit breaker pattern in RAG systems?**

A) To optimize memory usage  
B) To prevent cascading failures when document processing fails ‚úÖ  
C) To improve query response time  
D) To reduce infrastructure costs    

**Explanation:** The circuit breaker pattern is a critical resilience mechanism that temporarily stops requests to a failing service, preventing the failure from cascading throughout the system. When document processing fails repeatedly, the circuit breaker opens to give the system time to recover, rather than continuing to overwhelm it with requests.

### Question 2: Exponential Backoff Strategy

**Why is exponential backoff with jitter important in production RAG systems?**

A) It reduces system complexity  
B) It prevents thundering herd problems and distributes retry attempts ‚úÖ  
C) It improves semantic search accuracy  
D) It minimizes storage requirements    

**Explanation:** Exponential backoff increases delay between retry attempts exponentially, while jitter adds randomness to prevent all clients from retrying simultaneously. This combination prevents the "thundering herd" problem where multiple clients overwhelm a recovering service with synchronized retry attempts.

### Question 3: Production Monitoring

**What are the most critical monitoring metrics for production RAG systems?**

A) CPU usage and memory consumption only  
B) Response time, error rate, cache hit rate, and accuracy ‚úÖ  
C) Number of documents processed per hour  
D) Storage capacity and network bandwidth    

**Explanation:** Production RAG systems require comprehensive monitoring across multiple dimensions. Response time indicates performance, error rate shows reliability, cache hit rate measures efficiency, and accuracy ensures the system meets quality requirements. Monitoring only one metric provides an incomplete picture of system health.

### Question 4: Configuration Management

**What is the recommended approach for configuration management in production RAG systems?**

A) Store all configuration in the code  
B) Use only environment variables  
C) Combine file-based config with environment variable overrides ‚úÖ  
D) Use a single global configuration file    

**Explanation:** The 12-factor app methodology recommends using configuration files for defaults and environment variables for deployment-specific overrides. This approach provides flexibility for different environments (development, staging, production) while maintaining security and deployability.

### Question 5: Structured Logging

**What is the primary benefit of structured logging in production RAG systems?**

A) It reduces log file sizes  
B) Enables better debugging and monitoring with searchable, parseable logs ‚úÖ  
C) It eliminates the need for monitoring tools  
D) It improves query processing speed    

**Explanation:** Structured logging formats log entries as searchable, parseable data (typically JSON), enabling automated analysis, alerting, and debugging. This is essential for production systems where manual log analysis becomes impractical at scale.
