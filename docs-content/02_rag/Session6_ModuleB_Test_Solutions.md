# Session 6: Production GraphRAG Systems - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

**Question 1:** What is the primary benefit of distributed GraphRAG architectures?  

A) Reduced implementation complexity  
B) Lower operational costs  
C) Simplified deployment processes  
D) Horizontal scalability for large knowledge graphs and high query loads ‚úÖ  

**Explanation:** The primary benefit of distributed GraphRAG is horizontal scalability, enabling systems to handle knowledge graphs with millions of entities and relationships that exceed single-node capacity. Distributed architecture allows adding more machines to increase both storage capacity and processing power, supporting high query concurrency. While implementation complexity increases and costs may initially be higher, the scalability benefits are essential for enterprise-scale knowledge graphs that require consistent performance under heavy loads.

**Question 2:** What is the main challenge in implementing real-time updates for knowledge graphs?  

A) Maintaining consistency while providing low-latency access ‚úÖ  
B) User interface complexity  
C) Storage capacity limitations  
D) Network bandwidth constraints  

**Explanation:** The main challenge in real-time graph updates is balancing consistency with performance. Knowledge graphs have complex interdependencies where updates to one entity may affect related entities and relationships. Maintaining ACID properties while allowing concurrent reads during updates requires sophisticated coordination. The system must handle update ordering, conflict resolution, and distributed synchronization while ensuring queries continue to receive consistent results with minimal latency impact.

**Question 3:** What is the most effective sharding strategy for distributed GraphRAG systems?  

A) Random distribution across shards  
B) Size-based partitioning by entity count  
C) Entity-hash based sharding to maintain relationship locality ‚úÖ  
D) Geographic distribution by data source  

**Explanation:** Entity-hash based sharding is most effective because it maintains relationship locality while providing even distribution. This strategy uses consistent hashing on entity IDs to determine shard placement, ensuring related entities often reside on the same shard, which minimizes cross-shard queries during graph traversal. Unlike random distribution (which breaks locality) or size-based partitioning (which creates hotspots), entity-hash sharding balances load while preserving the graph structure benefits crucial for GraphRAG performance.

**Question 4:** Which metrics should be used for effective GraphRAG auto-scaling?  

A) Network throughput and disk I/O  
B) User count and session duration  
C) Query latency, CPU usage, memory usage, and queue length ‚úÖ  
D) Storage size only  

**Explanation:** Effective GraphRAG auto-scaling requires multiple complementary metrics. Query latency indicates user experience impact, CPU usage shows processing load, memory usage reflects data handling capacity, and queue length reveals system saturation. Using multiple metrics prevents false scaling decisions that could occur with single-metric approaches. Storage size alone is insufficient as it doesn't reflect real-time load, while user count doesn't account for query complexity variations that significantly impact resource requirements.

**Question 5:** What should trigger the highest priority alerts in production GraphRAG monitoring?  

A) CPU usage above 70%  
B) Network latency spikes  
C) High storage usage warnings  
D) Query failures or response time degradation affecting user experience ‚úÖ  

**Explanation:** Query failures and response time degradation should trigger the highest priority alerts because they directly impact user experience and business operations. When users cannot get answers or experience significant delays, it immediately affects productivity and satisfaction. While high storage usage, CPU usage, and network latency are important operational metrics, they become critical only when they start affecting query performance. The user-facing impact should always be the top priority in production monitoring systems.
