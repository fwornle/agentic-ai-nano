## Advanced RAG Prompt Engineering Framework

### The RAG Prompting Challenge

You have enhanced queries, optimized retrieval, and efficiently packed context. The final step is prompt engineering that maximizes the LLM's ability to use this carefully curated information. Generic prompts waste the intelligence you've built into your retrieval system. RAG-specific prompts extract maximum value from context while providing transparency and reliability assessment.

### Step 1: Advanced RAG Prompt Engineer Setup

Build the foundation for sophisticated prompt engineering:

```python
class RAGPromptEngineer:
    """Advanced prompt engineering specifically for RAG systems."""

    def __init__(self, llm_model):
        self.llm_model = llm_model

        # Domain-specific prompt templates
        self.prompt_templates = {
            'factual_qa': self._factual_qa_template,
            'analytical': self._analytical_template,
            'procedural': self._procedural_template,
            'comparative': self._comparative_template,
            'creative': self._creative_template,
            'technical': self._technical_template
        }
```

**Template Framework**: Different query types require specialized prompt structures that guide the LLM toward appropriate response patterns and information organization.

```python
        # Prompt optimization techniques
        self.optimization_techniques = {
            'chain_of_thought': self._add_chain_of_thought,
            'source_weighting': self._add_source_weighting,
            'confidence_calibration': self._add_confidence_calibration,
            'multi_step_reasoning': self._add_multi_step_reasoning,
            'context_analysis': self._add_context_analysis,
            'uncertainty_handling': self._add_uncertainty_handling
        }
```

**Optimization Techniques**: Advanced prompt optimization methods enhance response quality through structured reasoning, source attribution, and confidence assessment.

### Step 2: Core Prompt Engineering Workflow

Implement the main prompt engineering coordination system:

```python
def engineer_rag_prompt(self, query: str, context: str,
                       query_type: str = 'factual_qa',
                       optimizations: List[str] = ['confidence_calibration']) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Engineer optimized RAG prompt with specified techniques."""

    # Start with base template
    base_prompt = self.prompt_templates[query_type](query, context)

    # Apply optimization techniques
    optimized_prompt = base_prompt
    optimization_metadata = {}

    for technique in optimizations:
        if technique in self.optimization_techniques:
            result = self.optimization_techniques[technique](
                optimized_prompt, query, context
            )
            optimized_prompt = result['prompt']
            optimization_metadata[technique] = result['metadata']
```

**Sequential Optimization**: Applying optimization techniques iteratively builds up prompt sophistication while tracking the contribution of each enhancement.

```python
    return {
        'base_prompt': base_prompt,
        'optimized_prompt': optimized_prompt,
        'optimizations_applied': optimizations,
        'optimization_metadata': optimization_metadata,
        'query_type': query_type,
        'estimated_tokens': len(optimized_prompt.split()),
        'complexity_score': self._calculate_prompt_complexity(optimized_prompt)
    }
```

### Step 3: Advanced Template Systems

Create sophisticated templates for different query types:

#### Factual QA Template with Source Attribution

```python
def _factual_qa_template(self, query: str, context: str) -> str:
    """Optimized template for factual question answering."""

    return f"""You are an expert information analyst. Use the provided context to answer the user's question accurately and comprehensively.

```python
def _analytical_template(self, query: str, context: str) -> str:
    """Template for analytical queries requiring synthesis."""

    return f"""You are an expert analyst. Analyze the provided context to answer the analytical question comprehensively.

```

#### Technical Procedural Template

```python
def _technical_template(self, query: str, context: str) -> str:
    """Template for technical implementation questions."""

    return f"""You are a technical expert. Provide accurate technical guidance based on the provided documentation and context.

```python
def _add_chain_of_thought(self, base_prompt: str, query: str,
                        context: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Add chain-of-thought reasoning to prompt."""

    cot_enhancement = """

REASONING PROCESS:
Before providing your final answer, work through your reasoning step-by-step:

STEP 1 - CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
- What key information from the context relates to the question?
- How reliable and comprehensive is this information?
- Are there any gaps or contradictions in the context?

STEP 2 - INFORMATION EXTRACTION:
- What are the most relevant facts, data points, or insights?
- Which sources provide the strongest evidence?
- What examples or details support the main points?

STEP 3 - LOGICAL SYNTHESIS:
- How do the different pieces of information connect?
- What patterns or relationships can be identified?
- How do you resolve any contradictions or ambiguities?

STEP 4 - ANSWER CONSTRUCTION:
- What is the most accurate and complete answer based on the evidence?
- What are the confidence levels for different parts of the answer?
- What limitations or uncertainties should be acknowledged?

Let me work through this systematically:

STEP 1 - Context Analysis:
[Analyze the quality and relevance of provided context]

STEP 2 - Information Extraction:
[Extract and organize key information]

STEP 3 - Logical Synthesis:
[Connect information and identify patterns]

STEP 4 - Answer Construction:
[Build comprehensive, evidence-based answer]

FINAL ANSWER:
"""
```

**Structured Reasoning**: The four-step reasoning process ensures systematic analysis of context, leading to more thorough and reliable responses.

```python
    enhanced_prompt = base_prompt + cot_enhancement

    return {
        'prompt': enhanced_prompt,
        'metadata': {
            'technique': 'chain_of_thought',
            'added_tokens': len(cot_enhancement.split()),
            'reasoning_steps': 4,
            'systematic_analysis': True
        }
    }
```

### Step 5: Advanced Confidence Calibration

Implement sophisticated confidence assessment frameworks:

```python
def _add_confidence_calibration(self, base_prompt: str, query: str,
                              context: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Add advanced confidence calibration framework."""

    confidence_framework = self._build_advanced_confidence_framework()
    enhanced_prompt = base_prompt + confidence_framework

    return {
        'prompt': enhanced_prompt,
        'metadata': {
            'technique': 'confidence_calibration',
            'added_tokens': len(confidence_framework.split()),
            'assessment_dimensions': 5,
            'calibration_levels': ['evidence', 'completeness', 'certainty', 'limitations', 'overall']
        }
    }
```

#### Advanced Confidence Framework

```python
def _build_advanced_confidence_framework(self) -> str:
    """Build comprehensive confidence assessment framework."""

    return """

CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:

"""
```

### Step 6: Context Analysis Enhancement

Add sophisticated context quality analysis:

```python
def _add_context_analysis(self, base_prompt: str, query: str,
                         context: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Add context quality analysis to improve response accuracy."""

    context_analysis_enhancement = """

CONTEXT QUALITY ANALYSIS:
Before answering, analyze the quality and characteristics of the provided context:

CONTEXT ASSESSMENT:
1. RELEVANCE ANALYSIS:
   - How directly does the context address the specific question asked?
   - What percentage of the context is relevant vs. tangential?
   - Are there any irrelevant sections that should be ignored?

2. SOURCE EVALUATION:
   - How many distinct sources are represented in the context?
   - What types of sources are these (official docs, blogs, academic, etc.)?
   - Do sources appear credible and authoritative for this topic?

3. INFORMATION QUALITY:
   - Is the information current and up-to-date?
   - Are there any obvious errors, inconsistencies, or contradictions?
   - How detailed and comprehensive is the coverage?

4. COVERAGE ANALYSIS:
   - What aspects of the question are well-covered by the context?
   - What important aspects are missing or under-represented?
   - Are there gaps that affect the completeness of possible answers?

Based on this context analysis, I will now provide the most accurate answer possible while clearly acknowledging any limitations imposed by context quality.

CONTEXT ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
[Brief assessment of context quality and relevance]

"""
```

**Context-Aware Processing**: Explicit context analysis helps the LLM better understand the limitations and strengths of provided information.

### Step 7: Multi-Step Reasoning Enhancement

Implement complex reasoning structures for sophisticated queries:

```python
def _add_multi_step_reasoning(self, base_prompt: str, query: str,
                            context: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Add multi-step reasoning for complex analytical queries."""

    multi_step_enhancement = """

MULTI-STEP REASONING PROCESS:
For complex questions requiring synthesis, use this structured approach:

- Identify what types of information are needed for each component
- Determine the logical relationships between different components

STEP 2 - INFORMATION MAPPING:
- Map relevant context sections to each question component
- Identify which sources address which aspects of the question
- Note any information gaps or conflicts between sources

STEP 3 - COMPONENT ANALYSIS:
- Analyze each question component using relevant context
- Draw preliminary conclusions for each component
- Assess confidence level for each component answer

STEP 4 - INTEGRATION AND SYNTHESIS:
- Combine component analyses into a coherent overall answer
- Resolve any conflicts or contradictions between components
- Identify emergent insights from the integrated analysis

STEP 5 - VALIDATION AND REFINEMENT:
- Check if the integrated answer fully addresses the original question

STEP 4 - Integration and Synthesis:
[Combine analyses coherently]

STEP 5 - Validation and Refinement:
[Final validation and refinement]

INTEGRATED FINAL ANSWER:
"""
```

**Structured Reasoning**: Multi-step reasoning ensures complex questions are thoroughly analyzed through systematic decomposition and synthesis.

### Step 8: Dynamic Prompt Adaptation

Implement adaptive prompting based on query and context characteristics:

```python
class DynamicPromptAdapter:
    """Adapt prompts based on context quality and query characteristics."""

    def __init__(self, llm_model):
        self.llm_model = llm_model
        self.prompt_engineer = RAGPromptEngineer(llm_model)

    def adapt_prompt_dynamically(self, query: str, context: str,
                                retrieval_metadata: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Dynamically adapt prompt based on context and query analysis."""

        # Step 1: Analyze input characteristics
        context_analysis = self._analyze_context_quality(context, query)
        query_analysis = self._analyze_query_characteristics(query)

        # Step 2: Select optimal strategy
        prompt_strategy = self._select_prompt_strategy(
            context_analysis, query_analysis, retrieval_metadata
        )

        # Step 3: Generate adapted prompt
        adapted_prompt = self._generate_adapted_prompt(
            query, context, prompt_strategy
        )

        return {
            'adapted_prompt': adapted_prompt,
            'context_analysis': context_analysis,
            'query_analysis': query_analysis,
            'strategy': prompt_strategy,
            'adaptation_reasoning': self._explain_adaptation_reasoning(
                context_analysis, query_analysis, prompt_strategy
            )
        }
```

### Step 9: Context Quality Assessment

Implement sophisticated context analysis for adaptive prompting:

```python
def _analyze_context_quality(self, context: str, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyze the quality and characteristics of retrieved context."""

    # Basic metrics
    word_count = len(context.split())
    source_count = context.count('[Source:')

    # Quality assessment using LLM
    quality_prompt = f"""
    Analyze the quality of this context for answering the given query:

    Query: {query}
    Context: {context[:1000]}...

    Assess:
    1. Relevance (0-10): How well does context address the query?
    2. Completeness (0-10): How comprehensive is the information?
    3. Clarity (0-10): How clear and well-organized is the information?
    4. Reliability (0-10): How credible and authoritative are the sources?

    Provide scores and brief explanations:
    """
```

**Quality Metrics**: Comprehensive context analysis enables intelligent prompt adaptation based on information characteristics.

### Step 10: Query Complexity Analysis

Analyze query characteristics to guide prompt selection:

```python
def _analyze_query_characteristics(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyze query characteristics for prompt adaptation."""

    analysis_prompt = f"""
    Analyze this query's characteristics:

    Query: {query}

    Classify:
    1. Complexity (simple/moderate/complex): Based on number of concepts and relationships
    2. Type (factual/analytical/procedural/creative): Primary question type
    3. Scope (narrow/broad): How focused or wide-ranging is the question
    4. Reasoning Required (low/medium/high): Level of synthesis needed

    Return structured analysis:
    """

    try:
        response = self.llm_model.predict(analysis_prompt)
        return self._parse_query_analysis(response)
    except:
        return {
            'complexity': 'moderate',
            'type': 'factual',
            'scope': 'narrow',
            'reasoning_required': 'medium'
        }
```

### Step 11: Adaptive Strategy Selection

Select optimal prompt strategies based on analysis results:

```python
def _select_prompt_strategy(self, context_analysis: Dict,
                           query_analysis: Dict,
                           retrieval_metadata: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Select optimal prompt strategy based on analysis."""

    strategy = {
        'base_template': 'factual_qa',
        'optimizations': [],
        'reasoning_depth': 'basic'
    }

    # Adapt based on query complexity
    if query_analysis.get('complexity') == 'complex':
        strategy['optimizations'].append('multi_step_reasoning')
        strategy['reasoning_depth'] = 'advanced'

    # Adapt based on context quality
    context_quality = context_analysis.get('overall_quality', 0.5)
    if context_quality < 0.6:
        strategy['optimizations'].extend(['context_analysis', 'uncertainty_handling'])

    # Always add confidence calibration for RAG
    if 'confidence_calibration' not in strategy['optimizations']:
        strategy['optimizations'].append('confidence_calibration')

    # Adapt template based on query type
    query_type = query_analysis.get('type', 'factual')
    if query_type in ['analytical', 'procedural', 'technical']:
        strategy['base_template'] = query_type

    return strategy
```

## Testing Your Advanced Prompt Engineering System

Test the complete system with various scenarios:

```python

complex_context = "... comprehensive context about both architectures ..."

# Generate adaptive prompt
adaptive_result = adapter.adapt_prompt_dynamically(
    complex_query, complex_context, {'source_diversity': 0.8}
)

# Test with factual query and limited context
factual_query = "What is the capital of France?"
limited_context = "France is a country in Europe..."

factual_result = engineer.engineer_rag_prompt(
    factual_query, limited_context,
    query_type='factual_qa',

print(f"Adaptive strategy: {adaptive_result['strategy']}")
print(f"Prompt complexity: {factual_result['complexity_score']}")
print(f"Optimizations applied: {factual_result['optimizations_applied']}")

    """Production RAG system with advanced prompt engineering."""

    def __init__(self, llm_model, vector_store, tokenizer):
        self.hyde_enhancer = HyDEQueryEnhancer(llm_model, embedding_model)
        self.context_optimizer = ContextWindowOptimizer(tokenizer)

        )

        # Context optimization
        optimized_context = self.context_optimizer.optimize_context_window(

        prompt_result = self.prompt_adapter.adapt_prompt_dynamically(
            user_query, optimized_context['optimized_context'],
            {'retrieval_quality': len(retrieved_chunks)}
        )

        # Generate response
        response = self.llm_model.predict(prompt_result['adapted_prompt'])

        return {
            'response': response,
            'confidence_indicators': self._extract_confidence_indicators(response),
