# 🎯 Session 7: Agentic RAG Systems

In Sessions 1-6, you built sophisticated RAG systems that can chunk intelligently, search optimally, enhance queries semantically, evaluate scientifically, and reason through knowledge graphs. But when users ask questions requiring complex multi-step reasoning, tool usage, or self-correction, you discover that even GraphRAG has limitations: it can retrieve and connect information, but can't actively plan, execute actions, or validate its own reasoning.

This session transforms your RAG system from passive responder to active reasoner. You'll implement agentic architectures that can plan multi-step research strategies, execute complex information-gathering workflows, validate their own responses, and self-correct when initial approaches fail.

## 🎯 Observer Path: Essential Concepts

### Understanding the Cognitive Leap: From Retrieval to Reasoning

![RAG Reasoning Architecture](images/RAG-reasoning-3.webp)

The leap from traditional RAG to agentic RAG isn't just about adding more components – it's about fundamentally changing how the system approaches information challenges. Instead of fixed query-response patterns, agentic RAG develops reasoning strategies tailored to each information need.

Consider the difference: when asked "Should we acquire Company X?", traditional RAG retrieves documents about Company X and generates a summary. Agentic RAG plans a research strategy: analyze financials, assess market position, identify risks, evaluate synergies, then synthesize a reasoned recommendation.

### Traditional RAG vs Reasoning-Augmented RAG

**Traditional RAG Workflow:**
```
Query → Retrieve Documents → Generate Response
```

**Reasoning-Augmented RAG Workflow:**
```
Query → Analyze Reasoning Requirements → Plan Cognitive Strategy →
Reasoning-Guided Retrieval → Chain-of-Thought Synthesis →
Meta-Cognitive Validation → Logically Coherent Response
```

The fundamental shift is from reactive to proactive intelligence. Traditional RAG systems respond to queries with fixed patterns, while agentic RAG systems can plan research strategies, execute multi-step investigations, and autonomously course-correct to find better solutions.

### The Three Pillars of Reasoning-RAG Integration

#### 1. Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval (RAR)
**Core Principle**: "Let reasoning guide what information to find and how to connect it"

Instead of simple similarity search, this approach analyzes what type of reasoning is needed and uses that to guide information gathering.

```python
class ReasoningAugmentedRetrieval:
    """RAG system where reasoning frameworks guide retrieval strategies."""

    def __init__(self, vector_store, knowledge_graph, reasoning_engine):
        self.vector_store = vector_store
        self.knowledge_graph = knowledge_graph
        self.reasoning_engine = reasoning_engine
```

This system uses different reasoning strategies to intelligently guide information retrieval. The reasoning engine analyzes the query type and selects appropriate retrieval strategies.

```python
        # Map reasoning types to specific retrieval strategies
        self.reasoning_strategies = {
            'deductive': self._deductive_reasoning_retrieval,
            'inductive': self._inductive_reasoning_retrieval,
            'abductive': self._abductive_reasoning_retrieval,
            'analogical': self._analogical_reasoning_retrieval,
            'causal': self._causal_reasoning_retrieval
        }
```

Each reasoning type requires different information gathering approaches. Deductive reasoning needs premises and logical rules, while causal reasoning requires temporal sequences and cause-effect relationships.

#### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning (RAR)
**Core Principle**: "Let external knowledge fill logical reasoning gaps"

This approach identifies gaps in reasoning chains and uses targeted retrieval to fill missing information.

```python
class RetrievalAugmentedReasoning:
    """Reasoning system enhanced by strategic information retrieval."""

    def __init__(self, reasoning_framework, vector_store):
        self.reasoning_framework = reasoning_framework
        self.vector_store = vector_store
```

The system detects when reasoning chains have missing information and strategically retrieves specific knowledge to complete logical arguments.

```python
        self.gap_detection_strategies = {
            'premise_gap': self._detect_missing_premises,
            'evidence_gap': self._detect_insufficient_evidence,
            'logical_step_gap': self._detect_missing_logical_steps,
            'context_gap': self._detect_missing_context
        }
```

#### 3. Chain-of-Thought RAG Integration
**Core Principle**: "Structured reasoning paths that guide both retrieval and synthesis"

This combines structured reasoning with retrieval at each step of the thought process.

```python
class ChainOfThoughtRAG:
    """RAG system with integrated chain-of-thought reasoning."""

    def __init__(self, llm_model, vector_store, reasoning_framework):
        self.llm_model = llm_model
        self.vector_store = vector_store
        self.reasoning_framework = reasoning_framework
```

Each step in the reasoning chain can trigger retrieval to gather supporting information before proceeding to the next logical step.

## 📝 Participant Path: Practical Implementation

*Prerequisites: Complete Observer Path sections above*

### Building Your First Agentic RAG System

Let's implement a practical reasoning-driven RAG system that can handle complex queries requiring multi-step analysis.

#### Basic Reasoning Agent Implementation

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
import json
import asyncio

class BasicReasoningRAGAgent:
    """Simple agentic RAG system with reasoning capabilities."""

    def __init__(self, llm_model, vector_store):
        self.llm_model = llm_model
        self.vector_store = vector_store
        self.reasoning_history = []
```

This basic agent provides the foundation for agentic RAG functionality. The reasoning_history tracks the agent's thought processes for transparency and learning.

```python
    async def analyze_reasoning_requirements(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Analyze what type of reasoning the query requires."""

        analysis_prompt = f"""
        Analyze this query's reasoning requirements:
        Query: "{query}"

        Determine:
        1. Primary reasoning type (deductive, inductive, abductive, causal, analogical)
        2. Complexity level (simple, moderate, complex)
        3. Information requirements (facts, relationships, evidence, context)

        Return analysis as JSON with these fields.
        """

        response = await self.llm_model.generate(analysis_prompt, temperature=0.1)
        return json.loads(self._extract_json(response))
```

The reasoning requirements analysis is crucial for selecting appropriate strategies. Low temperature (0.1) ensures consistent analytical responses rather than creative interpretations.

```python
    async def plan_reasoning_strategy(self, query: str,
                                    analysis: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[str]:
        """Create step-by-step reasoning plan based on analysis."""

        planning_prompt = f"""
        Create a reasoning plan for this query:
        Query: "{query}"
        Analysis: {json.dumps(analysis)}

        Generate 3-5 logical steps that will lead to a complete answer.
        Format as JSON list of step descriptions.
        """

        response = await self.llm_model.generate(planning_prompt, temperature=0.2)
        return json.loads(self._extract_json(response))
```

The planning phase creates a structured approach to complex queries. Slightly higher temperature (0.2) allows for creative problem-solving while maintaining logical consistency.

#### Self-Correction Implementation

```python
    async def validate_reasoning_quality(self, response: str,
                                       original_query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Validate the logical quality of the generated response."""

        validation_prompt = f"""
        Evaluate this response for logical quality:

        Original Query: "{original_query}"
        Response: "{response}"

        Check for:
        1. Logical consistency
        2. Evidence support
        3. Reasoning gaps
        4. Conclusion validity

        Return evaluation as JSON with scores (0-1) and explanations.
        """

        response = await self.llm_model.generate(validation_prompt, temperature=0.1)
        return json.loads(self._extract_json(response))
```

This validation method acts as an internal critic, evaluating response quality before returning to users. The structured evaluation ensures consistent quality assessment.

```python
    async def self_correct(self, original_response: str, validation: Dict[str, Any],
                          query: str) -> str:
        """Improve response based on validation feedback."""

        if validation.get('overall_score', 1.0) < 0.7:
            correction_prompt = f"""
            Improve this response based on validation feedback:

            Original Response: "{original_response}"
            Issues Identified: {validation}
            Original Query: "{query}"

            Generate an improved response that addresses these issues.
            """

            improved_response = await self.llm_model.generate(correction_prompt)
            return improved_response

        return original_response
```

The self-correction mechanism only activates when quality falls below threshold (0.7), preventing unnecessary processing while ensuring quality standards.

#### Tool Integration Pattern

For advanced capabilities, agentic RAG systems often need external tools:

```python
class ToolIntegratedRAG:
    """RAG agent with external tool integration capabilities."""

    def __init__(self, llm_model, vector_store, available_tools):
        self.llm_model = llm_model
        self.vector_store = vector_store
        self.available_tools = available_tools
```

Tool integration enables RAG systems to go beyond document retrieval to access real-time data, perform calculations, or execute actions.

```python
    async def determine_tool_usage(self, query: str) -> List[str]:
        """Determine which tools are needed for this query."""

        tool_analysis_prompt = f"""
        Analyze if this query requires external tools:
        Query: "{query}"

        Available tools: {list(self.available_tools.keys())}

        Return list of needed tools or empty list if only document retrieval needed.
        """

        response = await self.llm_model.generate(tool_analysis_prompt)
        return json.loads(self._extract_json(response))
```

Smart tool selection prevents overuse while ensuring necessary capabilities are available when needed.
