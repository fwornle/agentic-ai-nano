## üìù Multiple Choice Test

### Question 1: Microservices Architecture

**What is the primary benefit of microservices architecture for RAG systems?**

A) Simplified development process  
B) Reduced infrastructure costs  
C) Better security by default  
D) Enables independent scaling and deployment of components ‚úÖ  
**Correct Answer: D) Enables independent scaling and deployment of components**

**Explanation:** Microservices architecture allows each service (ingestion, retrieval, generation) to be scaled independently based on demand. This means you can scale the computationally expensive generation service without scaling the entire system, optimizing resource utilization and costs. Independent deployment also enables rolling updates without downtime.

### Question 2: JWT Authentication

**Why is JWT authentication particularly important for enterprise RAG systems?**

A) It provides stateless, secure authentication with role-based access ‚úÖ  
B) It requires less computational resources  
C) It's easier to implement than other methods  
D) It's the only method that works with microservices  
**Correct Answer: A) It provides stateless, secure authentication with role-based access**

**Explanation:** JWT tokens are stateless, meaning they contain all necessary authentication information without requiring server-side session storage. This enables horizontal scaling and load balancing. JWTs also support role-based access control (RBAC) through claims, allowing fine-grained permissions for different resources and actions.

### Question 3: Circuit Breaker Pattern

**What is the purpose of the circuit breaker pattern in distributed RAG systems?**

A) To enhance semantic search accuracy  
B) To improve query response times  
C) To prevent cascading failures by temporarily disabling failing services ‚úÖ  
D) To optimize memory usage  
**Correct Answer: C) To prevent cascading failures by temporarily disabling failing services**

**Explanation:** Circuit breakers monitor service health and "open" when failure rates exceed thresholds, temporarily redirecting traffic away from failing services. This prevents cascading failures where one failing service brings down dependent services, allowing time for recovery and maintaining overall system stability.

### Question 4: Sensitive Data Handling

**How should enterprise RAG systems handle sensitive data?**

A) Store it in encrypted databases only  
B) Use access controls without encryption  
C) Encrypt at rest and in transit, with audit logging ‚úÖ  
D) Process it only in memory  
**Correct Answer: C) Encrypt at rest and in transit, with audit logging**

**Explanation:** Enterprise RAG systems often process sensitive data requiring comprehensive protection. Encryption at rest protects stored data, encryption in transit protects data during transmission, and audit logging provides compliance tracking and security monitoring. This layered approach meets enterprise security and regulatory requirements.

### Question 5: Enterprise Monitoring

**What metrics are most important for enterprise RAG system monitoring?**

A) Storage capacity utilization  
B) Number of documents processed  
C) CPU and memory usage only  
D) Response time, error rates, throughput, and business KPIs ‚úÖ  
**Correct Answer: D) Response time, error rates, throughput, and business KPIs**

**Explanation:** Enterprise monitoring requires multiple metric categories: response time for user experience, error rates for reliability, throughput for capacity planning, and business KPIs for value delivery. Monitoring only technical metrics misses the business impact, while monitoring only business metrics misses operational issues.
