# Session 1: Enterprise Deployment - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

**Question 1:** What is the primary benefit of microservices architecture for enterprise RAG systems?
A) Reduces development time
B) Enables independent scaling and deployment of components ‚úÖ
C) Simplifies codebase
D) Reduces infrastructure costs

**Explanation:** Microservices architecture allows each service (ingestion, retrieval, generation) to be scaled independently based on demand. This means you can scale the computationally expensive generation service without scaling the entire system, optimizing resource utilization and costs. Independent deployment also enables rolling updates without downtime.

**Question 2:** Why is JWT authentication important for enterprise RAG systems?
A) It improves query performance
B) It provides stateless, secure authentication with role-based access ‚úÖ
C) It reduces memory usage
D) It enables caching

**Explanation:** JWT tokens are stateless, meaning they contain all necessary authentication information without requiring server-side session storage. This enables horizontal scaling and load balancing. JWTs also support role-based access control (RBAC) through claims, allowing fine-grained permissions for different resources and actions.

**Question 3:** What is the purpose of circuit breaker pattern in high availability systems?
A) To reduce costs
B) To prevent cascading failures by temporarily disabling failing services ‚úÖ
C) To improve accuracy
D) To enable load balancing

**Explanation:** Circuit breakers monitor service health and "open" when failure rates exceed thresholds, temporarily redirecting traffic away from failing services. This prevents cascading failures where one failing service brings down dependent services, allowing time for recovery and maintaining overall system stability.

**Question 4:** How should enterprise RAG systems handle sensitive data?
A) Store in plain text for performance
B) Encrypt at rest and in transit, with audit logging ‚úÖ
C) Use only public data
D) Store in separate databases only

**Explanation:** Enterprise RAG systems often process sensitive data requiring comprehensive protection. Encryption at rest protects stored data, encryption in transit protects data during transmission, and audit logging provides compliance tracking and security monitoring. This layered approach meets enterprise security and regulatory requirements.

**Question 5:** What metrics are most important for enterprise RAG monitoring?
A) Only response time
B) Response time, error rates, throughput, and business KPIs ‚úÖ
C) Only error counts
D) Only resource utilization

**Explanation:** Enterprise monitoring requires multiple metric categories: response time for user experience, error rates for reliability, throughput for capacity planning, and business KPIs for value delivery. Monitoring only technical metrics misses the business impact, while monitoring only business metrics misses operational issues.
