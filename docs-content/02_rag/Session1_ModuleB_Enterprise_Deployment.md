## Enterprise Deployment Architecture

### **Architecture Pattern 1: Microservices RAG Deployment**

Enterprise RAG systems require scalable, maintainable architectures that can handle high concurrent loads.

We start by importing the necessary modules for building enterprise microservices architecture. The async capabilities are essential for handling concurrent requests at scale:

```python
# Enterprise microservices architecture for RAG
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
import asyncio
from dataclasses import dataclass
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
```

The data structures define the contract between microservices. These standardized request/response formats enable loose coupling and independent service evolution:

```python
@dataclass
class RAGRequest:
    query: str
    user_id: str
    session_id: str
    context_filters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    max_tokens: int = 1000
```

The response dataclass captures all information needed for client applications and monitoring systems:

```python
@dataclass
class RAGResponse:
    answer: str
    sources: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    confidence: float
    processing_time: float
    request_id: str
```

The service interface establishes a common contract for all RAG microservices. This abstraction enables service substitution and testing without affecting dependent services:

```python
class RAGServiceInterface(ABC):
    """Interface for RAG microservices."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def process_query(self, request: RAGRequest) -> RAGResponse:
        pass
```

The Document Ingestion Service handles the heavy lifting of document processing. Separating this into its own service allows for independent scaling based on ingestion workload:

```python
class DocumentIngestionService(RAGServiceInterface):
    """Microservice responsible for document processing and indexing."""
    
    def __init__(self, vector_store_url: str, processing_queue_url: str):
        self.vector_store_url = vector_store_url
        self.processing_queue_url = processing_queue_url
```

The batch processing method demonstrates enterprise-grade error handling. Each document is processed independently, ensuring that failures don't affect the entire batch:

```python
    async def ingest_document_batch(self, documents: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Process and index a batch of documents."""
        results = {
            "processed": 0,
            "failed": 0,
            "processing_time": 0.0,
            "document_ids": []
        }
```

The core processing loop implements fault tolerance by isolating each document's processing. This ensures partial batch success even when individual documents fail:

```python
        # Implement batch processing with queue management
        for doc in documents:
            try:
                doc_id = await self._process_single_document(doc)
                results["document_ids"].append(doc_id)
                results["processed"] += 1
            except Exception as e:
                results["failed"] += 1
                
        return results
```

The Retrieval Service implements federated search across multiple vector stores. This architecture enables scaling retrieval capacity horizontally:

```python
class RetrievalService(RAGServiceInterface):
    """Microservice for document retrieval and ranking."""
    
    def __init__(self, vector_stores: List[str], reranker_endpoint: str):
        self.vector_stores = vector_stores
        self.reranker_endpoint = reranker_endpoint
```

Multi-database retrieval with reranking provides both redundancy and improved relevance. The service aggregates results from multiple sources and applies sophisticated ranking algorithms:

```python
    async def retrieve_documents(self, query: str, filters: Dict) -> List[Dict]:
        """Retrieve and rank relevant documents."""
        # Implement multi-database retrieval
        all_results = []
```

The retrieval process queries multiple vector stores concurrently, collecting diverse results from different data sources:

```python
        for store_url in self.vector_stores:
            store_results = await self._query_vector_store(store_url, query, filters)
            all_results.extend(store_results)
```

After collecting all results, we apply reranking to improve result quality and remove duplicates across data sources:

```python
        # Rerank combined results
        ranked_results = await self._rerank_documents(query, all_results)
        return ranked_results
```

The Generation Service implements load balancing with automatic failover. This ensures high availability even when individual LLM endpoints experience issues:

```python
class GenerationService(RAGServiceInterface):
    """Microservice for answer generation."""
    
    def __init__(self, llm_endpoints: List[str], load_balancer: str):
        self.llm_endpoints = llm_endpoints
        self.load_balancer = load_balancer
```

The generation method implements graceful failover by attempting each endpoint in sequence until one succeeds:

```python
    async def generate_answer(self, query: str, context: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Generate answer using retrieved context."""
        # Implement load-balanced generation with fallback
        for endpoint in self.llm_endpoints:
            try:
                response = await self._call_llm_endpoint(endpoint, query, context)
                return response
            except Exception as e:
                continue  # Try next endpoint
                
        raise Exception("All LLM endpoints unavailable")
```

### **Architecture Pattern 2: Enterprise Security and Compliance**

Enterprise security requires robust cryptographic libraries and secure token handling. These imports provide the foundation for authentication, encryption, and audit logging:

```python
import hashlib
import hmac
import time
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
import jwt
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
```

The EnterpriseSecurity class initialization sets up cryptographic components. The separation of secret keys and encryption keys follows security best practices for different use cases:

```python
class EnterpriseSecurity:
    """Enterprise-grade security for RAG systems."""
    
    def __init__(self, secret_key: str, encryption_key: bytes):
        self.secret_key = secret_key
        self.cipher = Fernet(encryption_key)
```

JWT authentication provides stateless, scalable user verification. The token validation includes expiration checking to ensure tokens can't be used indefinitely:

```python
    def authenticate_request(self, token: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Validate JWT authentication token."""
        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(token, self.secret_key, algorithms=["HS256"])
```

Time-based validation prevents replay attacks and ensures tokens have limited lifetimes:

```python
            # Check token expiration
            if payload.get("exp", 0) < time.time():
                return None
                
            return payload
            
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
            return None
```

Role-based access control (RBAC) enables fine-grained permissions. This approach allows different users to have specific access to resources and actions:

```python
    def authorize_access(self, user_payload: Dict, resource: str, action: str) -> bool:
        """Check user authorization for specific resource and action."""
        user_permissions = user_payload.get("permissions", [])
        required_permission = f"{resource}:{action}"
        
        return required_permission in user_permissions or "admin:*" in user_permissions
```

Data encryption ensures sensitive information is protected at rest and in transit. Fernet provides authenticated encryption that prevents tampering:

```python
    def encrypt_sensitive_data(self, data: str) -> str:
        """Encrypt sensitive data for storage."""
        return self.cipher.encrypt(data.encode()).decode()
    
    def decrypt_sensitive_data(self, encrypted_data: str) -> str:
        """Decrypt sensitive data for processing."""
        return self.cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data.encode()).decode()
```

Comprehensive audit logging is essential for compliance and security monitoring. This creates an immutable record of all security-relevant events:

```python
    def audit_log(self, user_id: str, action: str, resource: str, success: bool):
        """Log security-relevant events for compliance."""
        audit_entry = {
            "timestamp": time.time(),
            "user_id": user_id,
            "action": action,
            "resource": resource,
            "success": success,
            "ip_address": self._get_client_ip()
        }
```

The audit entry is then written to a secure, append-only logging system for compliance and forensic analysis:

```python
        # Write to audit log (implement your logging backend)
        self._write_audit_log(audit_entry)
```

### **Architecture Pattern 3: High Availability and Disaster Recovery**

High availability systems require sophisticated health monitoring and failover mechanisms. These imports provide the foundation for async operations and structured data:

```python
import asyncio
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
import time
```

Service health states provide clear categorization of system status. The three-state model allows for gradual degradation rather than binary up/down status:

```python
class ServiceHealth(Enum):
    HEALTHY = "healthy"
    DEGRADED = "degraded"
    UNHEALTHY = "unhealthy"
```

The HealthCheck dataclass captures comprehensive service status information. This structured approach enables automated decision-making for failover and alerting:

```python
@dataclass
class HealthCheck:
    service_name: str
    status: ServiceHealth
    response_time: float
    last_check: float
    error_message: Optional[str] = None
```

The HighAvailabilityRAG class initialization sets up primary and backup endpoints. This dual-endpoint architecture ensures continuity even when primary services fail:

```python
class HighAvailabilityRAG:
    """High availability RAG system with failover capabilities."""
    
    def __init__(self, primary_endpoints: Dict[str, str], backup_endpoints: Dict[str, str]):
        self.primary_endpoints = primary_endpoints
        self.backup_endpoints = backup_endpoints
        self.health_status = {}
        self.circuit_breakers = {}
```

Concurrent health checking maximizes efficiency while monitoring multiple services. The gather operation with exception handling ensures one failing service doesn't block others:

```python
    async def health_check_all_services(self) -> Dict[str, HealthCheck]:
        """Perform health checks on all services."""
        tasks = []
```

We create concurrent health check tasks for all services to minimize overall monitoring latency:

```python
        for service_name, endpoint in self.primary_endpoints.items():
            task = self._check_service_health(service_name, endpoint)
            tasks.append(task)
            
        health_results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

Health status processing transforms raw results into actionable service status. Exception handling ensures comprehensive status tracking even when health checks fail:

```python
        # Update health status
        for i, (service_name, _) in enumerate(self.primary_endpoints.items()):
            if isinstance(health_results[i], Exception):
                self.health_status[service_name] = HealthCheck(
                    service_name=service_name,
                    status=ServiceHealth.UNHEALTHY,
                    response_time=0.0,
                    last_check=time.time(),
                    error_message=str(health_results[i])
                )
```

Successful health checks are stored directly, providing current service status for routing decisions:

```python
            else:
                self.health_status[service_name] = health_results[i]
                
        return self.health_status
```

The failover mechanism implements graceful degradation with automatic fallback. This approach maximizes service availability by trying backup services when primaries fail:

```python
    async def execute_with_failover(self, service_name: str, operation: callable) -> Any:
        """Execute operation with automatic failover to backup services."""
        
        # Try primary endpoint
        if self._is_service_healthy(service_name):
            try:
                return await operation(self.primary_endpoints[service_name])
            except Exception as e:
                self._mark_service_unhealthy(service_name, str(e))
```

If the primary service fails, we automatically attempt the backup service to maintain availability:

```python
        # Failover to backup endpoint
        if service_name in self.backup_endpoints:
            try:
                return await operation(self.backup_endpoints[service_name])
            except Exception as e:
                raise Exception(f"Both primary and backup services failed for {service_name}")
        
        raise Exception(f"No healthy endpoints available for {service_name}")
```

### **Architecture Pattern 4: Enterprise Monitoring and Alerting**

Enterprise monitoring requires comprehensive alerting and metrics collection. These imports provide the foundation for time-based metrics and structured alerting:

```python
import time
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Callable
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
```

Alert severity levels provide clear prioritization for operational teams. This three-tier system enables appropriate response based on impact and urgency:

```python
class AlertSeverity(Enum):
    INFO = "info"
    WARNING = "warning"
    CRITICAL = "critical"
```

The Alert dataclass captures all information needed for effective incident response. This structured approach enables automated routing and escalation:

```python
@dataclass
class Alert:
    service: str
    metric: str
    value: float
    threshold: float
    severity: AlertSeverity
    timestamp: float
    message: str
```

The EnterpriseMonitoring class initialization sets up the monitoring infrastructure. This centralized approach enables consistent monitoring across all RAG services:

```python
class EnterpriseMonitoring:
    """Enterprise monitoring and alerting for RAG systems."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {}
        self.alert_rules = {}
        self.alert_handlers = []
```

Alert rule registration enables flexible threshold management. This dynamic configuration allows operators to adjust monitoring without code changes:

```python
    def register_alert_rule(self, metric_name: str, threshold: float, 
                          severity: AlertSeverity, comparison: str = "greater"):
        """Register an alerting rule for a specific metric."""
        self.alert_rules[metric_name] = {
            "threshold": threshold,
            "severity": severity,
            "comparison": comparison
        }
```

Metric recording with automatic alert checking provides real-time monitoring. This approach ensures immediate detection of threshold violations:

```python
    def record_metric(self, service: str, metric_name: str, value: float):
        """Record a metric value and check for alerts."""
        key = f"{service}.{metric_name}"
        
        if key not in self.metrics:
            self.metrics[key] = []
```

Each metric value is timestamped and stored, building a historical record for trend analysis:

```python
        self.metrics[key].append({
            "value": value,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        })
        
        # Check for alerts
        self._check_alerts(service, metric_name, value)
```

The alert checking logic begins with rule lookup and threshold comparison logic. This flexible approach supports both upper and lower bound monitoring:

```python
    def _check_alerts(self, service: str, metric_name: str, value: float):
        """Check if metric value triggers any alerts."""
        if metric_name in self.alert_rules:
            rule = self.alert_rules[metric_name]
```

The comparison logic supports different threshold types to handle various monitoring scenarios:

```python
            should_alert = False
            if rule["comparison"] == "greater" and value > rule["threshold"]:
                should_alert = True
            elif rule["comparison"] == "less" and value < rule["threshold"]:
                should_alert = True
```

When a threshold violation is detected, we construct a comprehensive alert object with all necessary context for effective incident response:

```python
            if should_alert:
                alert = Alert(
                    service=service,
                    metric=metric_name,
                    value=value,
                    threshold=rule["threshold"],
                    severity=rule["severity"],
                    timestamp=time.time(),
                    message=f"{service} {metric_name} is {value}, exceeding threshold {rule['threshold']}"
                )
```

The alert is then sent to all registered handlers for appropriate response and escalation:

```python
                self._trigger_alert(alert)
```

Alert triggering with handler resilience ensures notifications reach operations teams even if some handlers fail:

```python
    def _trigger_alert(self, alert: Alert):
        """Trigger an alert using registered handlers."""
        for handler in self.alert_handlers:
            try:
                handler(alert)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Alert handler failed: {e}")
```
