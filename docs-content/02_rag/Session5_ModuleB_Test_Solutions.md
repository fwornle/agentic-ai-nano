# Session 5: Enterprise Monitoring & Alerting - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test - Session 5

**Question 1:** What metrics should have the highest priority in SLA monitoring for RAG systems?  

A) CPU and memory utilization  
B) Network bandwidth and throughput  
C) Availability and response time impacting user access ‚úÖ  
D) Storage usage and log file size  

**Explanation:** Availability and response time are the highest priority SLA metrics because they directly impact user experience and business continuity. When RAG systems are unavailable or slow, users cannot access the service, which immediately affects productivity and user satisfaction. Storage usage, log file size, and network bandwidth are important operational metrics but don't have the immediate user impact that availability and performance do.

**Question 2:** What is the primary purpose of compliance monitoring in enterprise RAG systems?  

A) Improving system performance and reducing costs  
B) Ensuring regulatory requirements are met and audit trails are maintained ‚úÖ  
C) Optimizing resource allocation and scaling  
D) Enhancing user experience and interface design  

**Explanation:** Compliance monitoring's primary purpose is ensuring adherence to regulatory frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, and ISO27001. This includes validating data processing activities, maintaining immutable audit trails, and demonstrating compliance during regulatory audits. While performance improvements and cost reduction may be secondary benefits, regulatory compliance is legally mandated and takes priority over operational optimizations.

**Question 3:** What should executive dashboards for RAG systems primarily display?  

A) Business impact metrics like user satisfaction and cost efficiency ‚úÖ  
B) Server hardware status and network topology  
C) Detailed error reports and debugging information  
D) Technical performance metrics and system logs  

**Explanation:** Executive dashboards should translate technical performance into business value metrics. Leaders need to understand user satisfaction trends, cost per query, productivity impact, and revenue effects rather than technical implementation details. These business impact metrics enable informed decision-making about resource allocation, scaling, and strategic direction for RAG system investments.

**Question 4:** What is the main benefit of ensemble anomaly detection approaches?  

A) They require less computational resources  
B) They are faster than single-algorithm approaches  
C) It reduces false positives by combining multiple detection approaches ‚úÖ  
D) They are easier to configure and maintain  

**Explanation:** Ensemble anomaly detection combines multiple algorithms (Isolation Forest, LSTM, statistical methods) to reduce false positives and improve detection accuracy. Each method has different strengths: Isolation Forest excels at multivariate outliers, LSTM captures temporal patterns, and statistical methods detect distribution changes. By requiring consensus from multiple detectors, ensemble approaches provide more reliable anomaly identification.

**Question 5:** What must be included in regulatory audit trails for RAG systems?  

A) Only error logs and performance metrics  
B) Just configuration changes and system updates  
C) Data processing events, compliance checks, and user access records ‚úÖ  
D) Only user queries and response times  

**Explanation:** Regulatory audit trails must comprehensively document all activities that could affect data privacy, security, or compliance. This includes data processing events (queries, retrievals, responses), compliance validation results, user access patterns, and system modifications. Error logs, performance metrics, and configuration changes are important but insufficient alone - regulators require complete activity documentation for compliance verification.
