- HNSW integration for hybrid similarity-structure search  
- Advanced graph optimization techniques  

## The Three-Stage NodeRAG Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: Graph Decomposition

NodeRAG performs multi-granularity decomposition that creates specialized node types based on knowledge structure:

```python
def noderag_decomposition(document):
    """NodeRAG Stage 1: Multi-granularity knowledge decomposition"""

    # Initialize parallel extraction systems
    semantic_extractor = SemanticConceptExtractor()
    entity_extractor = CanonicalEntityExtractor()
    relationship_extractor = TypedRelationshipExtractor()
```

This initialization sets up specialized extractors for different knowledge types. Each extractor uses domain-specific techniques - semantic concepts use topic modeling, entities use NER with canonicalization, and relationships use dependency parsing.

```python
    # Parallel specialized extraction
    semantic_units = semantic_extractor.extract(document)
    entities = entity_extractor.extract(document)
    relationships = relationship_extractor.extract(document)
    attributes = extract_entity_properties(document)
    document_nodes = create_document_segments(document)
```

The parallel extraction ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining processing efficiency. Each extractor operates independently, allowing for specialized optimization.

```python
    return {
        'semantic_units': semantic_units,
        'entities': entities,
        'relationships': relationships,
        'attributes': attributes,
        'document_nodes': document_nodes
    }
```

### Stage 2: Graph Augmentation

This stage builds the heterogeneous graph structure by creating specialized connections between different node types:

```python
def noderag_augmentation(decomposition_result):
    """NodeRAG Stage 2: Heterogeneous graph construction"""

    # Create typed connections between specialized nodes
    semantic_entity_links = link_concepts_to_entities(
        decomposition_result['semantic_units'],
        decomposition_result['entities']
    )
```

The linking process uses semantic similarity and co-occurrence patterns to connect abstract concepts with concrete entities. This enables traversal from conceptual queries to specific factual information.

```python
    # Build HNSW similarity edges within the graph structure
    hnsw_similarity_edges = build_hnsw_graph_edges(
        all_nodes=decomposition_result,
        similarity_threshold=0.75
    )
```

HNSW integration provides efficient similarity search within the graph structure. The similarity threshold ensures only high-confidence connections are included.

```python
    # Cross-reference integration across node types
    cross_references = integrate_cross_type_references(
        decomposition_result
    )

    return build_heterogeneous_graph(
        nodes=decomposition_result,
        typed_connections=semantic_entity_links,
        similarity_edges=hnsw_similarity_edges,
        cross_references=cross_references
    )
```

### Stage 3: Graph Enrichment

The final stage builds reasoning pathways using Personalized PageRank to identify semantically important nodes:

```python
def noderag_enrichment(heterogeneous_graph):
    """NodeRAG Stage 3: Reasoning pathway construction"""

    # Apply Personalized PageRank for semantic importance
    pagerank_scores = personalized_pagerank(
        graph=heterogeneous_graph,
        node_type_weights={
            'semantic_unit': 0.25,
            'entity': 0.30,
            'relationship': 0.20,
            'attribute': 0.10,
            'document': 0.10,
            'summary': 0.05
        }
    )
```

The weighted PageRank approach prioritizes different node types based on their typical importance in reasoning tasks. Entities receive the highest weight as they're often query targets.

```python
    # Construct logical reasoning pathways
    reasoning_pathways = build_reasoning_pathways(
        graph=heterogeneous_graph,
        pagerank_scores=pagerank_scores,
        max_pathway_length=5
    )
```

Reasoning pathways represent coherent chains of logical connections that enable multi-hop queries. The length limit prevents information explosion while maintaining reasoning capability.

```python
    # Optimize graph structure for reasoning performance
    optimized_graph = optimize_for_reasoning(
        graph=heterogeneous_graph,
        pathways=reasoning_pathways,
        access_patterns=analyze_query_patterns()
    )

    return {
        'graph': optimized_graph,
        'pathways': reasoning_pathways,
        'importance_scores': pagerank_scores
    }
```

## Advanced Personalized PageRank Implementation

### Heterogeneous Graph PageRank

Traditional PageRank assumes uniform node types, but NodeRAG requires type-aware importance calculation:

```python
def personalized_pagerank(graph, node_type_weights,
                         damping=0.85, max_iterations=100):
    """Personalized PageRank for heterogeneous graphs"""

    # Initialize scores with type-aware priors
    node_scores = {}
    for node, data in graph.nodes(data=True):
        node_type = data.get('type', 'unknown')
        prior_weight = node_type_weights.get(node_type, 0.1)
        node_scores[node] = prior_weight
```

Type-aware initialization ensures different node types start with appropriate importance levels based on their typical relevance in reasoning tasks.

```python
    # Iterative score propagation with type awareness
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        prev_scores = node_scores.copy()

        for node in graph.nodes():
            # Calculate incoming score from neighbors
            incoming_score = 0.0
            for neighbor in graph.predecessors(node):
                neighbor_type = graph.nodes[neighbor].get('type')
                type_transfer_rate = calculate_type_transfer_rate(
                    source_type=neighbor_type,
                    target_type=graph.nodes[node].get('type')
                )

                neighbor_outgoing = len(list(graph.successors(neighbor)))
                if neighbor_outgoing > 0:
                    incoming_score += (prev_scores[neighbor] *
                                     type_transfer_rate / neighbor_outgoing)
```

The type transfer rate modulates how importance flows between different node types, enabling more nuanced importance propagation.

```python
            # Apply damping with personalized restart
            node_type = graph.nodes[node].get('type', 'unknown')
            personalization_weight = node_type_weights.get(node_type, 0.1)

            node_scores[node] = (
                (1 - damping) * personalization_weight +
                damping * incoming_score
            )
```

The personalized restart ensures that certain node types maintain baseline importance even without incoming connections.

## HNSW Integration for Hybrid Search

### Building Similarity Edges in Graph Structure

HNSW provides efficient similarity search, but NodeRAG integrates it directly into the graph structure:

```python
def build_hnsw_graph_edges(all_nodes, similarity_threshold=0.75):
    """Build HNSW similarity edges for graph integration"""

    # Extract embeddings from all node types
    node_embeddings = {}
    for node_type, nodes in all_nodes.items():
        for node in nodes:
            if hasattr(node, 'embedding'):
                node_embeddings[node.id] = {
                    'embedding': node.embedding,
                    'type': node_type,
                    'content': node.content
                }
```

Embedding extraction preserves both the vector representation and the semantic type information needed for heterogeneous similarity calculation.

```python
    # Build HNSW index with type-aware similarity
    import hnswlib

    dim = len(next(iter(node_embeddings.values()))['embedding'])
    hnsw_index = hnswlib.Index(space='cosine', dim=dim)
    hnsw_index.init_index(max_elements=len(node_embeddings))

    # Add embeddings with node type metadata
    node_ids = list(node_embeddings.keys())
    embeddings = [node_embeddings[nid]['embedding'] for nid in node_ids]
    hnsw_index.add_items(embeddings, node_ids)
```

The HNSW index maintains node ID mapping to preserve the connection between similarity results and graph structure.

```python
    # Generate similarity edges with type compatibility
    similarity_edges = []

    for node_id in node_ids:
        # Query for similar nodes
        similar_ids, distances = hnsw_index.knn_query(
            node_embeddings[node_id]['embedding'],
            k=10  # Top 10 similar nodes
        )

        source_type = node_embeddings[node_id]['type']

        for sim_id, distance in zip(similar_ids[0], distances[0]):
            if sim_id != node_id:  # Skip self-similarity
                similarity_score = 1.0 - distance
                target_type = node_embeddings[sim_id]['type']

                # Check type compatibility for similarity connections
                if (similarity_score >= similarity_threshold and
                    types_compatible_for_similarity(source_type, target_type)):

                    similarity_edges.append({
                        'source': node_id,
                        'target': sim_id,
                        'weight': similarity_score,
                        'edge_type': 'similarity',
                        'source_type': source_type,
                        'target_type': target_type
                    })

    return similarity_edges
```

### Type Compatibility for Similarity Connections

Not all node types should be connected through similarity - the compatibility matrix ensures logical connections:

```python
def types_compatible_for_similarity(type1, type2):
    """Determine if two node types should have similarity connections"""

    # Define compatibility matrix for similarity connections
    compatibility_matrix = {
        'semantic_unit': ['semantic_unit', 'entity', 'summary'],
        'entity': ['entity', 'semantic_unit', 'document'],
        'relationship': ['relationship', 'semantic_unit'],
        'attribute': ['attribute', 'entity'],
        'document': ['document', 'entity', 'summary'],
        'summary': ['summary', 'semantic_unit', 'document']
    }

    return type2 in compatibility_matrix.get(type1, [])
```

This compatibility matrix prevents illogical similarity connections (e.g., attributes shouldn't be similar to relationships) while enabling meaningful cross-type connections.

## Advanced Graph Optimization Techniques

### Query Pattern Analysis for Graph Optimization

NodeRAG analyzes query patterns to optimize graph structure for common access patterns:

```python
def optimize_for_reasoning(graph, pathways, access_patterns):
    """Optimize graph structure based on reasoning patterns"""

    # Analyze frequent pathway patterns
    frequent_patterns = analyze_pathway_frequency(pathways)

    # Identify bottleneck nodes that appear in many pathways
    bottleneck_nodes = identify_bottlenecks(
        pathways,
        threshold=0.8  # Nodes appearing in >80% of pathways
    )
```

Bottleneck identification helps prioritize which nodes should have optimized access patterns and which connections should be strengthened.

```python
    # Create shortcut edges for frequent multi-hop patterns
    shortcut_edges = []
    for pattern in frequent_patterns:
        if len(pattern) >= 3:  # Multi-hop patterns only
            source_node = pattern[0]
            target_node = pattern[-1]

            # Create direct edge with aggregated evidence
            shortcut_weight = calculate_pathway_strength(pattern)
            shortcut_edges.append({
                'source': source_node,
                'target': target_node,
                'weight': shortcut_weight,
                'edge_type': 'reasoning_shortcut',
                'evidence_pathway': pattern
            })
```

Shortcut edges provide direct connections for frequently traversed pathways while maintaining the evidence chain for explanation purposes.

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Memory-Efficient Graph Representation

Large-scale NodeRAG systems require careful memory management:

```python
class OptimizedNodeRAGGraph:
    """Memory-efficient NodeRAG graph implementation"""

    def __init__(self, compression_level='medium'):
        self.compression_level = compression_level
        self.node_store = {}
        self.edge_indices = {}
        self.embedding_cache = LRUCache(maxsize=10000)
```

The LRU cache ensures frequently accessed embeddings remain in memory while less common ones are computed on-demand.

```python
    def add_node_with_compression(self, node_id, node_data):
        """Add node with appropriate compression based on type"""

        node_type = node_data.get('type')

        if node_type in ['document', 'summary']:
            # Compress text content for large nodes
            compressed_content = self.compress_text(node_data['content'])
            node_data['content'] = compressed_content
            node_data['compressed'] = True

        elif node_type == 'entity':
            # Keep entity data uncompressed for fast access
            pass

        self.node_store[node_id] = node_data
```

Selective compression balances memory usage with access performance based on node type characteristics and access patterns.
