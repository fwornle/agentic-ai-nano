# Session 6: Advanced Graph Algorithms - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

**Question 1:** What is the main advantage of Temporal PageRank over traditional PageRank?

A) Simpler implementation
B) Considers information freshness and time-based relationships ‚úÖ
C) Uses less memory
D) Faster computation speed

**Explanation:** Temporal PageRank's main advantage is incorporating time-based decay into the ranking algorithm, ensuring that newer information receives higher importance scores. This is crucial for domains like news, research, or rapidly evolving knowledge where information freshness significantly impacts relevance. The algorithm applies exponential decay to edge weights based on their age, making it ideal for GraphRAG systems that need to prioritize recent information over outdated content.

**Question 2:** What do the parameters p and q control in Node2Vec?

A) Return probability and in-out bias for walk exploration ‚úÖ
B) Embedding dimensions and epochs
C) Distance metrics and similarity functions
D) Learning rate and batch size

**Explanation:** The parameters p and q in Node2Vec control the bias of random walks to capture different graph structures. Parameter p controls the return probability (likelihood of returning to the previous node), while q controls the in-out parameter (preference for exploring outward versus staying local). Higher p values encourage local exploration, while higher q values promote exploration of distant nodes. These parameters allow Node2Vec to capture both local neighborhood structures and broader graph connectivity patterns.

**Question 3:** Why is community detection crucial for large-scale GraphRAG systems?

A) It organizes knowledge into coherent clusters for better retrieval ‚úÖ
B) It simplifies graph visualization
C) It reduces computational complexity
D) It eliminates the need for embeddings

**Explanation:** Community detection is crucial for large-scale GraphRAG systems because it organizes the knowledge graph into semantically coherent clusters, enabling more targeted and efficient retrieval. By identifying densely connected groups of related entities, community detection helps narrow search spaces, improves query relevance, and enables hierarchical navigation of knowledge structures. This organization particularly benefits complex domains where different topic areas can be clearly separated.

**Question 4:** What is the key advantage of Graph Attention Networks (GATs)?

A) Learn adaptive importance weights for different relationships and neighbors ‚úÖ
B) They have faster inference times
C) They use simpler architectures
D) They require less training data

**Explanation:** Graph Attention Networks (GATs) provide the key advantage of learning adaptive attention weights that determine how much influence each neighbor has on a node's representation. Unlike traditional graph neural networks that treat all neighbors equally, GATs can dynamically focus on the most relevant relationships for each specific node and context. This adaptive weighting enables more sophisticated reasoning and better captures the varying importance of different connections in knowledge graphs.

**Question 5:** When should you use biased random walks instead of uniform random walks?

A) When you want to reduce memory usage
B) When the graph is very small
C) When you need to explore specific regions or relationship types more thoroughly ‚úÖ
D) When you want faster traversal

**Explanation:** Biased random walks are preferred over uniform walks when you need to systematically explore certain parts of the graph or relationship types more thoroughly. The p and q parameters in Node2Vec allow fine-tuning exploration strategies: emphasizing local neighborhoods for structural roles, or promoting broader exploration for bridging relationships. This targeted exploration is particularly valuable in heterogeneous knowledge graphs where different relationship types require different traversal strategies.
