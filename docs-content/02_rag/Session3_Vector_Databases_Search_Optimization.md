## **Part 1: Vector Database Architecture Deep Dive (25 minutes)**

### **Understanding Vector Database Design**

Vector databases are specialized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors efficiently:

```python
# Core vector database operations - Interface definition
class VectorDatabaseInterface:
    """Abstract interface for vector database operations."""

    def __init__(self, dimension: int, metric: str = "cosine"):
        self.dimension = dimension
        self.metric = metric  # cosine, euclidean, dot_product
```

This interface establishes the contract that all vector database implementations must follow. The metric parameter is crucial for RAG applications - cosine similarity works best for text embeddings since it handles varying document lengths naturally.

```python
    def add_vectors(self, vectors: List[List[float]],
                   metadata: List[Dict], ids: List[str]):
        """Add vectors with metadata and IDs."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

The add_vectors method defines the core insertion operation for vector databases. By accepting vectors, metadata, and IDs as separate lists, this design enables batch operations while maintaining data integrity.

```python
    def search(self, query_vector: List[float],
              top_k: int = 10, filters: Dict = None):
        """Search for similar vectors with optional filtering."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

The search method is the heart of any vector database. The filters parameter is essential for production RAG systems where you need to filter by document type, date, or user permissions before computing similarity.

```python
    def update_vector(self, vector_id: str,
                     new_vector: List[float], new_metadata: Dict):
        """Update existing vector and metadata."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

### **ChromaDB Implementation**

ChromaDB offers a lightweight, open-source solution ideal for development and moderate-scale production:

### **ChromaDB Production Implementation**

ChromaDB stands out as an excellent choice for **development and moderate-scale production deployments** due to its:
- **Zero-configuration startup** with SQLite backend (perfect for prototyping)
- **Open-source flexibility** with no vendor lock-in
- **Built-in HNSW indexing** for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search
- **Python-native integration** that simplifies development workflows

However, ChromaDB has limitations at enterprise scale (>10M vectors) compared to specialized solutions like Pinecone or Qdrant. The trade-offs we're making:

**‚úÖ Advantages**: Simple setup, local development, cost-effective, good performance up to ~1M vectors
**‚ùå Limitations**: Memory constraints at scale, single-node architecture, limited enterprise features

**Step 1: Initialize ChromaDB with Optimization Strategy**

Our optimization strategy focuses on three key areas:
1. **HNSW parameter tuning** for the sweet spot between speed and accuracy
2. **Persistent storage configuration** to avoid index rebuilding
3. **Memory management** for stable production performance

```python
# Advanced ChromaDB setup - Core imports and class definition
import chromadb
from chromadb.config import Settings
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Tuple
```

We start with essential imports for ChromaDB integration. The Settings import is crucial for production configuration, while numpy handles vector operations efficiently.

```python
class ChromaVectorStore:
    """Advanced ChromaDB wrapper with optimization features.

    This implementation prioritizes:
    - HNSW index optimization for 100k-1M document collections
    - Persistent storage for production reliability
    - Batch operations for efficient data loading
    - Memory-conscious configuration for stable performance
    """
```

Our ChromaDB wrapper focuses on production-ready optimization. The class handles the sweet spot for ChromaDB: moderate-scale collections where its simplicity and performance shine.

```python
    def __init__(self, persist_directory: str, collection_name: str):
        self.persist_directory = persist_directory
        self.collection_name = collection_name

        # Performance tracking for optimization feedback
        self.query_times = []
        self.build_times = []
```

The constructor establishes the foundation for our ChromaDB implementation. The performance tracking attributes allow us to monitor and optimize query performance over time.

**Step 2: Client Configuration with Production Settings**

The client configuration directly impacts both performance and reliability:

```python
        # Initialize client with optimized settings
        self.client = chromadb.PersistentClient(
            path=persist_directory,
            settings=Settings(
                allow_reset=True,        # Enables index rebuilding during development
                anonymized_telemetry=False  # Reduces network calls in production
            )
        )
```

The PersistentClient ensures our vector index survives application restarts - critical for production systems. The settings optimize for both development flexibility and production performance.

```python
        # Create or get collection with optimized settings
        self.collection = self._initialize_collection()
```

**Why these settings matter:**
- **`PersistentClient`**: Ensures our vector index survives application restarts (critical for production)
- **`allow_reset=True`**: Enables development flexibility but should be `False` in production
- **`anonymized_telemetry=False`**: Eliminates external network dependencies

**Step 3: HNSW Index Optimization Strategy**

The HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm is the heart of ChromaDB's performance. Our parameter choices reflect a **balanced approach optimized for RAG workloads**:

```python
    def _initialize_collection(self):
        """Initialize collection with carefully tuned HNSW parameters.

        Parameter Selection Rationale:
        - cosine similarity: Optimal for text embeddings (handles normalization)
        - construction_ef=200: Higher accuracy during index building (2-3x query ef)
        - M=16: Sweet spot for memory vs. connectivity (typical range: 12-48)
        - search_ef=100: Balances speed vs. accuracy for RAG recall requirements
        """
```

This method handles the critical task of collection initialization with optimized HNSW parameters. The parameter choices reflect extensive research into optimal settings for RAG workloads.

```python
        try:
            # Try to get existing collection
            collection = self.client.get_collection(
                name=self.collection_name
            )
            print(f"Loaded existing collection: {self.collection_name}")
```

The method first attempts to load an existing collection - this prevents accidentally recreating indexes and losing data. Always check for existing collections in production code.

```python
        except ValueError:
            # Create new collection with optimized HNSW settings
            collection = self.client.create_collection(
                name=self.collection_name,
                metadata={
                    "hnsw:space": "cosine",           # Cosine similarity for text embeddings
                    "hnsw:construction_ef": 200,     # Build-time accuracy (higher = better quality)
                    "hnsw:M": 16,                     # Node connectivity (higher = more memory, better recall)
                    "hnsw:search_ef": 100             # Query-time speed/accuracy trade-off
                }
            )
            print(f"Created new collection: {self.collection_name}")
```

When creating a new collection, we specify HNSW parameters that balance performance and accuracy. These settings are optimized for typical RAG workloads with moderate-scale document collections.

```python
        return collection
```

**HNSW Parameter Deep Dive:**

- **`hnsw:space="cosine"`**: Critical for text embeddings since cosine similarity handles varying document lengths naturally. Alternative metrics like L2 can be dominated by document length rather than semantic similarity.

- **`construction_ef=200`**: Controls the dynamic candidate list size during index construction. Higher values (200-400) create more accurate graphs but take longer to build. We choose 200 as a sweet spot for most RAG applications.

- **`M=16`**: The bi-directional link count per node. This is perhaps the most critical parameter:
  - **M=8-12**: Lower memory, faster insertion, potentially lower recall
  - **M=16**: Balanced choice for most applications
  - **M=32+**: Higher memory usage but excellent recall (use for high-accuracy requirements)

- **`search_ef=100`**: The query-time exploration parameter. We can tune this per-query based on accuracy needs:
  - **ef=50**: Fast searches, ~85-90% recall
  - **ef=100**: Our default, ~92-95% recall
  - **ef=200+**: Highest accuracy, slower queries

**Step 2: Batch Operations for Performance**

Batch processing is essential for efficient data loading. ChromaDB performs better with moderately-sized batches rather than individual document inserts.

```python
    def add_documents_batch(self, documents: List[str],
                           embeddings: List[List[float]],
                           metadata: List[Dict],
                           ids: List[str],
                           batch_size: int = 1000):
        """Add documents in optimized batches."""
        total_docs = len(documents)
        print(f"Adding {total_docs} documents in batches of {batch_size}")
```

Batch processing is essential for efficient data loading. ChromaDB performs better with moderately-sized batches rather than individual document inserts.

```python
        for i in range(0, total_docs, batch_size):
            batch_end = min(i + batch_size, total_docs)

            batch_documents = documents[i:batch_end]
            batch_embeddings = embeddings[i:batch_end]
            batch_metadata = metadata[i:batch_end]
            batch_ids = ids[i:batch_end]
```

Each iteration creates a batch slice from the input data. The `min()` function ensures the final batch doesn't exceed available data when the total isn't evenly divisible.

```python
            self.collection.add(
                documents=batch_documents,
                embeddings=batch_embeddings,
                metadatas=batch_metadata,
                ids=batch_ids
            )

            print(f"Added batch {i//batch_size + 1}/{(total_docs-1)//batch_size + 1}")
```

### **Pinecone Production Setup**

**Why Choose Pinecone for Production RAG?**

Pinecone represents the **enterprise-grade managed solution** that scales beyond what self-hosted options can handle efficiently. The strategic decision to use Pinecone involves several key considerations:

**‚úÖ Enterprise Advantages:**
- **Horizontal scaling**: Auto-scales from millions to billions of vectors
- **High availability**: Built-in replication and failover mechanisms
- **Zero maintenance**: No index management, hardware provisioning, or performance tuning required
- **Advanced features**: Namespaces, metadata filtering, real-time updates with no performance degradation
- **Global distribution**: Multi-region deployment for low-latency worldwide access

**‚ùå Cost Considerations:**
- **Usage-based pricing**: Can become expensive at scale (~$0.09-0.36 per 1M queries)
- **Vendor lock-in**: Proprietary format makes migration challenging
- **Cold start latency**: Managed infrastructure may have occasional latency spikes

**Strategic Positioning**: Pinecone is optimal when reliability, scalability, and developer productivity outweigh cost concerns. Typical use cases include production RAG systems with >1M vectors, multi-tenant applications, and enterprise deployments requiring 99.9%+ uptime.

```python
# Production Pinecone implementation - Core imports
import pinecone
import time
from typing import List, Dict, Any
```

Pinecone represents the managed, enterprise-grade solution for vector search. These imports provide the core functionality for production deployment.

```python
class PineconeVectorStore:
    """Production-ready Pinecone vector store with enterprise optimizations.

    This implementation focuses on:
    - Cost-effective pod configuration for RAG workloads
    - High availability through strategic replication
    - Metadata indexing for efficient filtering
    - Batch operations optimized for Pinecone's rate limits
    """
```

Our Pinecone wrapper emphasizes enterprise concerns: cost optimization, high availability, and operational efficiency. This reflects real-world production requirements.

```python
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, environment: str,
                 index_name: str, dimension: int = 1536):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.environment = environment
        self.index_name = index_name
        self.dimension = dimension
```

The constructor establishes the connection parameters for Pinecone. The default dimension of 1536 matches OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model.

```python
        # Performance and cost tracking
        self.operation_costs = {'queries': 0, 'upserts': 0, 'deletes': 0}
        self.batch_stats = {'successful_batches': 0, 'failed_batches': 0}
```

Cost tracking is essential for Pinecone's usage-based pricing model. Monitoring operations helps optimize expenses in production environments.

```python
        # Initialize Pinecone with connection pooling
        pinecone.init(
            api_key=api_key,
            environment=environment
        )
        self.index = self._get_or_create_index()
```

**Step 3: Strategic Index Configuration**

Our Pinecone configuration balances **performance, cost, and reliability** for typical RAG workloads:

#### **Step 2a: Check for Existing Index**

First, we check if the index already exists to avoid recreation costs:

```python
    def _get_or_create_index(self):
        """Get existing index or create with production-optimized configuration."""
        
        # Check if index exists
        if self.index_name in pinecone.list_indexes():
            print(f"Connecting to existing index: {self.index_name}")
            index = pinecone.Index(self.index_name)
```

First, we check if the index already exists to avoid recreation costs. This is critical for production systems where index creation can be expensive.

```python
            # Log current index configuration for monitoring
            stats = index.describe_index_stats()
            print(f"Index stats: {stats['total_vector_count']} vectors, "
                  f"{stats['dimension']} dimensions")
            return index
```

#### **Step 2b: Create Production-Optimized Index**

If no index exists, create one with carefully chosen production parameters:

```python
        # Create new index with carefully chosen parameters
        print(f"Creating new index: {self.index_name}")
        pinecone.create_index(
            name=self.index_name,
            dimension=self.dimension,
            metric='cosine',              # Optimal for text embeddings
            pods=2,                       # 2 pods handle ~5000 QPS efficiently
            replicas=1,                   # High availability with cost control
```

If no index exists, we create one with carefully chosen production parameters. The cosine metric is optimal for text embeddings, and the pod configuration balances performance with cost.

```python
            pod_type='p1.x1',            # Balanced performance pod (1.5GB RAM)
            metadata_config={
                'indexed': ['source', 'chunk_type', 'timestamp', 'topic']  # Enable fast filtering
            }
        )
```

#### **Step 2c: Wait for Index Initialization**

Pinecone requires initialization time - we wait and monitor the status:

```python
        # Wait for index initialization (typically 30-60 seconds)
        print("Waiting for index to be ready...")
        while not pinecone.describe_index(self.index_name).status['ready']:
            time.sleep(5)  # Check every 5 seconds
```

Pinecone requires initialization time - we wait and monitor the status to ensure the index is ready before use.

```python
        print("Index ready for operations!")
        return pinecone.Index(self.index_name)
```

**Configuration Rationale:**
- **pods=2**: Balances cost vs. performance for moderate query load (1000-5000 QPS)
- **replicas=1**: Provides failover without doubling costs (99.9% uptime)  
- **pod_type='p1.x1'**: Cost-effective choice for most RAG applications
- **metadata indexing**: Enables efficient filtering without full scans

**Critical Parameter Analysis:**

**Pod Configuration Strategy:**
- **`pods=2`**: Our choice handles 2000-5000 queries per second cost-effectively. Scaling decisions:
  - **1 pod**: Development/testing (~1000 QPS max)
  - **2-4 pods**: Production RAG systems (~2000-10000 QPS)
  - **8+ pods**: High-traffic applications (>20000 QPS)

**Replication for Reliability:**
- **`replicas=1`**: Provides automatic failover while keeping costs reasonable
- **Cost impact**: Each replica doubles your bill, so balance uptime requirements vs. budget
- **Latency benefit**: Replicas can serve traffic from multiple regions

**Pod Type Selection:**
- **`p1.x1`**: 1.5GB RAM, optimal for most RAG applications with moderate metadata
- **`p1.x2`**: 3GB RAM, use when heavy metadata filtering or large batch operations
- **`s1.x1`**: Storage-optimized, 25% cheaper but slower queries (acceptable for some use cases)

**Metadata Indexing Strategy:**
- **Indexed fields**: Only index fields you'll filter on frequently (each field increases costs)
- **Common RAG filters**: `source` (document origin), `chunk_type` (paragraph/header/table), `timestamp` (recency filtering)
- **Performance impact**: Indexed metadata enables sub-50ms filtered queries vs. 200ms+ without indexing

**Step 4: Advanced Upsert Operations**

```python
    def upsert_vectors_batch(self, vectors: List[Dict],
                           batch_size: int = 100,
                           namespace: str = "default"):
        """Efficient batch upsert with error handling."""
        total_vectors = len(vectors)
        successful_upserts = 0
        failed_upserts = []
```

Batch upserts are critical for Pinecone performance and cost efficiency. We track success/failure rates to monitor system health and identify problematic data.

```python
        for i in range(0, total_vectors, batch_size):
            batch = vectors[i:i + batch_size]

            try:
                # Upsert batch with retry logic
                response = self.index.upsert(
                    vectors=batch,
                    namespace=namespace
                )
```

The upsert operation updates existing vectors or inserts new ones. Namespaces provide data isolation - useful for multi-tenant applications.

```python
                successful_upserts += response.upserted_count
                print(f"Upserted batch {i//batch_size + 1}: "
                      f"{response.upserted_count} vectors")

            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Failed to upsert batch {i//batch_size + 1}: {e}")
                failed_upserts.extend(batch)
```

Error handling ensures robust operation even when individual batches fail. We collect failed vectors for retry or analysis.

```python
        return {
            'successful': successful_upserts,
            'failed': failed_upserts,
            'total': total_vectors
        }
```

### **Qdrant High-Performance Setup**

Qdrant offers excellent performance and advanced filtering capabilities:

```python
# High-performance Qdrant implementation - Imports
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.http import models
from qdrant_client.http.models import Distance, VectorParams, OptimizersConfig
```

Qdrant provides high-performance vector search with excellent filtering capabilities. These imports give us access to the full configuration API for optimization.

```python
class QdrantVectorStore:
    """High-performance Qdrant vector store."""

    def __init__(self, host: str = "localhost", port: int = 6333,
                 collection_name: str = "documents"):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port
        self.collection_name = collection_name
```

Qdrant excels in scenarios requiring complex filtering and high-performance search. It's particularly strong for applications with rich metadata requirements.

```python
        # Initialize client
        self.client = QdrantClient(
            host=host,
            port=port,
            timeout=60  # Extended timeout for large operations
        )
        self._setup_collection()
```

**Step 5: Optimized Collection Configuration**

Qdrant's collection setup provides extensive optimization options. Let's configure each component for optimal RAG performance.

```python
    def _setup_collection(self, dimension: int = 1536):
        """Create collection with performance optimizations."""
        # Check if collection exists
        collections = self.client.get_collections().collections
        collection_names = [c.name for c in collections]

        if self.collection_name not in collection_names:
```

First, we check for existing collections to avoid recreating indexes. This is essential for production systems where index recreation is expensive.

```python
            # Create collection with optimized vector configuration
            self.client.create_collection(
                collection_name=self.collection_name,
                vectors_config=VectorParams(
                    size=dimension,
                    distance=Distance.COSINE,
                    on_disk=True  # Store vectors on disk for memory efficiency
                ),
```

The vector configuration sets cosine distance (optimal for text) and enables disk storage to manage memory usage efficiently with large datasets.

```python
                optimizers_config=OptimizersConfig(
                    deleted_threshold=0.2,
                    vacuum_min_vector_number=1000,
                    default_segment_number=2,
                    max_segment_size=200000,
                    memmap_threshold=200000,
                    indexing_threshold=20000,
                    flush_interval_sec=1,
                    max_optimization_threads=2
                ),
```

Optimizer configuration controls how Qdrant manages segments and memory. These settings balance performance with resource usage for typical RAG workloads.

```python
                hnsw_config=models.HnswConfig(
                    m=16,  # Number of bi-directional connections
                    ef_construct=200,  # Size of dynamic candidate list
                    full_scan_threshold=10000,  # Threshold for full scan
                    max_indexing_threads=2,  # Parallel indexing
                    on_disk=True  # Store index on disk
                )
            )
            print(f"Created optimized collection: {self.collection_name}")
        else:
            print(f"Using existing collection: {self.collection_name}")
```

## **Part 2: Hybrid Search Implementation (25 minutes)**

### **Semantic + Lexical Search Fusion**

Hybrid search combines vector similarity with traditional keyword search for enhanced relevance:

```python
# Hybrid search implementation - Core imports
import re
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple, Set
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import numpy as np
```

Hybrid search combines the semantic understanding of vector search with the precision of keyword matching. These imports provide the tools for both approaches.

```python
class HybridSearchEngine:
    """Advanced hybrid search combining semantic and lexical retrieval."""

    def __init__(self, vector_store, documents: List[str]):
        self.vector_store = vector_store
        self.documents = documents
```

Our hybrid engine takes a vector store and the original documents. The documents are needed to build the lexical search index for keyword matching.

```python
        # Initialize TF-IDF for lexical search
        self.tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
            max_features=10000,
            stop_words='english',
            ngram_range=(1, 2),  # Include bigrams
            lowercase=True,
            token_pattern=r'\b[a-zA-Z]\w{2,}\b'  # Words with 3+ chars
        )
```

The TF-IDF vectorizer configuration balances vocabulary size with performance. Including bigrams captures important phrase patterns in the text.

```python
        # Fit TF-IDF on document corpus
        self.tfidf_matrix = self.tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
        print(f"Built TF-IDF index for {len(documents)} documents")
```

**Step 6: BM25 Implementation - The Science of Lexical Ranking**

**Why BM25 Outperforms Simple TF-IDF for RAG:**

BM25 (Best Matching 25) represents decades of information retrieval research, addressing critical limitations of TF-IDF:

1. **Term Frequency Saturation**: TF-IDF grows linearly with term frequency, but BM25 uses logarithmic saturation (diminishing returns for repeated terms)
2. **Document Length Normalization**: BM25 accounts for document length bias more effectively than TF-IDF
3. **Parameter Tuning**: k1 and b parameters allow optimization for specific document collections

**Parameter Selection Strategy:**
- **k1=1.2**: Controls term frequency saturation. Higher values (1.5-2.0) favor exact term matches, lower values (0.8-1.0) reduce over-emphasis on repetition
- **b=0.75**: Controls document length normalization. Higher values (0.8-1.0) penalize long documents more, lower values (0.5-0.7) are more lenient

```python
    def _compute_bm25_scores(self, query: str, k1: float = 1.2,
                           b: float = 0.75) -> np.ndarray:
        """Compute BM25 scores using optimized algorithm for RAG workloads.

        BM25 Formula: IDF * (tf * (k1 + 1)) / (tf + k1 * (1 - b + b * dl / avgdl))
        """
```

The BM25 algorithm provides superior ranking compared to basic TF-IDF by addressing term frequency saturation and document length normalization issues.

```python
        # Tokenize query using same preprocessing as corpus
        query_tokens = self.tfidf_vectorizer.build_analyzer()(query.lower())

        # Pre-compute document statistics for efficiency
        doc_lengths = np.array([len(doc.split()) for doc in self.documents])
        avg_doc_length = np.mean(doc_lengths)
        scores = np.zeros(len(self.documents))
```

We tokenize the query using the same preprocessing as the corpus to ensure consistency. Pre-computing document statistics improves efficiency.

```python
        # Process each query term
        for token in query_tokens:
            if token in self.tfidf_vectorizer.vocabulary_:
                # Retrieve term statistics from pre-built TF-IDF matrix
                term_idx = self.tfidf_vectorizer.vocabulary_[token]
                tf_scores = self.tfidf_matrix[:, term_idx].toarray().flatten()
                tf = tf_scores * len(self.documents)
```

For each query term, we extract term frequency data from our pre-built TF-IDF matrix. This reuses computation and ensures consistent preprocessing.

```python
                # Calculate BM25 components
                df = np.sum(tf > 0)  # Document frequency
                if df > 0:
                    idf = np.log((len(self.documents) - df + 0.5) / (df + 0.5))
                    numerator = tf * (k1 + 1)
                    denominator = tf + k1 * (1 - b + b * doc_lengths / avg_doc_length)
                    scores += idf * (numerator / denominator)

        return scores
```

**BM25 vs. TF-IDF Performance Insights:**

For typical RAG scenarios, BM25 provides **15-25% better precision** compared to basic TF-IDF because:

1. **Query term emphasis**: BM25's saturation prevents documents with excessive repetition from dominating results
2. **Length fairness**: Better handling of varying document sizes (critical when mixing abstracts, paragraphs, and full articles)
3. **Rare term boosting**: Superior handling of distinctive query terms that are rare in the corpus

**When to Adjust Parameters:**
- **Increase k1 (1.5-2.0)**: When exact term matching is critical (legal documents, technical manuals)
- **Decrease k1 (0.8-1.0)**: When conceptual similarity matters more than exact matches
- **Increase b (0.8-1.0)**: When document length varies dramatically and you want to normalize aggressively
- **Decrease b (0.5-0.7)**: When longer documents naturally contain more relevant information

**Step 7: Fusion Strategies**

Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) provides an elegant way to combine semantic and lexical search results without needing to normalize different scoring scales.

```python
    def hybrid_search(self, query: str, top_k: int = 10,
                     semantic_weight: float = 0.7,
                     lexical_weight: float = 0.3,
                     rerank: bool = True) -> List[Dict]:
        """Perform hybrid search with multiple fusion strategies."""

        # Step 1: Semantic search
        semantic_results = self.vector_store.similarity_search_with_scores(
            query, k=min(top_k * 3, 50)  # Retrieve more for reranking
        )
```

We retrieve more results initially (3x target) to provide the reranker with a broader set of candidates. This improves final result quality.

```python
        # Step 2: Lexical search (BM25)
        lexical_scores = self._compute_bm25_scores(query)

        # Step 3: Combine scores using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
        combined_results = self._reciprocal_rank_fusion(
            semantic_results, lexical_scores, k=60
        )
```

RRF elegantly combines rankings from different systems without requiring score normalization. The k=60 parameter controls fusion smoothness.

```python
        # Step 4: Optional reranking
        if rerank:
            combined_results = self._cross_encoder_rerank(
                query, combined_results
            )

        return combined_results[:top_k]
```

RRF elegantly combines rankings from different systems without requiring score normalization. The k=60 parameter controls fusion smoothness.

```python
    def _reciprocal_rank_fusion(self, semantic_results: List[Tuple],
                               lexical_scores: np.ndarray,
                               k: int = 60) -> List[Dict]:
        """Implement Reciprocal Rank Fusion for score combination."""
        # Create document score dictionary
        doc_scores = {}
```

RRF converts rankings to reciprocal scores: RRF = 1/(k + rank). This gives higher scores to better-ranked items while avoiding division by zero.

```python
        # Add semantic scores (convert similarity to rank)
        for rank, (doc, similarity_score) in enumerate(semantic_results):
            doc_id = doc.metadata.get('chunk_id', rank)
            doc_scores[doc_id] = {
                'document': doc,
                'semantic_rrf': 1 / (k + rank + 1),
                'semantic_score': similarity_score
            }
```

Semantic results are processed first, converting similarity rankings to RRF scores. Each document gets its semantic ranking contribution.

```python
        # Add lexical scores (BM25 rankings)
        lexical_rankings = np.argsort(-lexical_scores)  # Descending order
        for rank, doc_idx in enumerate(lexical_rankings[:len(semantic_results)]):
            doc_id = doc_idx  # Assuming document index as ID

            if doc_id in doc_scores:
                doc_scores[doc_id]['lexical_rrf'] = 1 / (k + rank + 1)
                doc_scores[doc_id]['lexical_score'] = lexical_scores[doc_idx]
            else:
                # Create entry for lexical-only results
                doc_scores[doc_id] = {
                    'document': self.documents[doc_idx],
                    'semantic_rrf': 0,
                    'lexical_rrf': 1 / (k + rank + 1),
                    'semantic_score': 0,
                    'lexical_score': lexical_scores[doc_idx]
                }
```

We process lexical rankings similarly, creating entries for documents found only by keyword search. This ensures comprehensive coverage.

```python
        # Calculate final RRF scores and sort
        for doc_id in doc_scores:
            semantic_rrf = doc_scores[doc_id].get('semantic_rrf', 0)
            lexical_rrf = doc_scores[doc_id].get('lexical_rrf', 0)
            doc_scores[doc_id]['final_score'] = semantic_rrf + lexical_rrf

        sorted_results = sorted(
            doc_scores.values(),
            key=lambda x: x['final_score'],
            reverse=True
        )
        return sorted_results
```

### **Cross-Encoder Reranking**

Cross-encoders provide more accurate relevance scoring by processing query-document pairs jointly:

```python
# Cross-encoder reranking implementation
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

class AdvancedReranker:
    """Cross-encoder based reranking for improved precision."""

    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2"):
        self.cross_encoder = CrossEncoder(model_name)
        self.model_name = model_name
        print(f"Loaded cross-encoder model: {model_name}")
```

Cross-encoders provide superior relevance scoring by processing query-document pairs together, capturing interaction patterns that bi-encoders miss.

```python
    def rerank_results(self, query: str, documents: List[Dict],
                      top_k: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
        """Rerank documents using cross-encoder scores."""
        if not documents:
            return []

        # Prepare query-document pairs
        pairs = []
        for doc_data in documents:
            doc_text = self._extract_text(doc_data)
            pairs.append([query, doc_text])
```

We create query-document pairs for joint processing. The cross-encoder can then capture semantic relationships between query terms and document content.

```python
        # Get cross-encoder scores and update documents
        ce_scores = self.cross_encoder.predict(pairs)

        for i, doc_data in enumerate(documents):
            doc_data['rerank_score'] = float(ce_scores[i])
            doc_data['original_rank'] = i + 1
```

The cross-encoder processes all pairs simultaneously for efficiency, then we update each document with its reranking score and preserve the original ranking.

```python
        # Sort by cross-encoder scores
        reranked = sorted(
            documents,
            key=lambda x: x['rerank_score'],
            reverse=True
        )
        return reranked[:top_k]
```

## **Part 3: Performance Optimization Strategies (20 minutes)**

### **Vector Index Optimization - HNSW vs IVF Trade-offs**

**The Core Decision: Graph vs Clustering Approaches**

Choosing between HNSW and IVF represents one of the most critical architectural decisions in RAG systems. Each approach embodies fundamentally different philosophies for organizing high-dimensional spaces:

**HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: Graph-based approach creating navigable connections between similar vectors
**IVF (Inverted File)**: Clustering-based approach grouping similar vectors into searchable buckets

### **Strategic Decision Matrix:**

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Index** | **Rationale** |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Real-time RAG (<100ms latency required) | **HNSW** | Consistent low latency, no clustering overhead |
| Large-scale batch processing (>10M vectors) | **IVF + PQ** | Memory efficiency, compression, cost-effectiveness |
| Development/prototyping | **HNSW** | Simple tuning, predictable performance |
| Memory-constrained environments | **IVF + PQ** | Superior compression ratios |
| High-accuracy requirements (>95% recall) | **HNSW** | Better recall-latency trade-offs |
| Write-heavy workloads (frequent updates) | **IVF** | More efficient incremental updates |

**Advanced Vector Index Implementation**

Let's implement an intelligent vector index that automatically selects optimal strategies:

```python
# Advanced indexing strategies with decision logic
import faiss
import numpy as np
from typing import Tuple
```

FAISS provides high-performance implementations of multiple indexing algorithms. Our intelligent wrapper will select the optimal approach based on data characteristics.

```python
class OptimizedVectorIndex:
    """Advanced vector indexing with intelligent algorithm selection.

    This implementation automatically selects the optimal indexing strategy
    based on dataset characteristics and performance requirements.
    """

    def __init__(self, dimension: int, index_type: str = "auto"):
        self.dimension = dimension
        self.index_type = index_type
        self.index = None
        self.id_map = {}  # Map internal IDs to external IDs
        self.performance_metrics = {}  # Track build and search performance
```

**Main Index Building Method**

The core method that handles intelligent index construction:

```python
    def build_index(self, vectors: np.ndarray,
                   external_ids: List[str],
                   performance_target: str = "balanced") -> None:
        """Build optimized index with intelligent algorithm selection.
        """
        n_vectors = vectors.shape[0]
        memory_gb = vectors.nbytes / (1024**3)
```

We start by analyzing the dataset characteristics - size and memory requirements drive our algorithm selection strategy.

```python
        # Auto-select optimal index type based on data characteristics
        if self.index_type == "auto":
            self.index_type = self._select_optimal_index(
                n_vectors, memory_gb, performance_target
            )

        print(f"Building {self.index_type} index for {n_vectors:,} vectors "
              f"({memory_gb:.1f}GB)")
        build_start = time.time()
```

**Index Type Selection and Building**

Actual index construction based on the selected algorithm:

```python
        # Build index using selected algorithm
        if self.index_type == "HNSW":
            self.index = self._build_hnsw_index(vectors, performance_target)
        elif self.index_type == "IVF":
            self.index = self._build_ivf_index(vectors, n_vectors, performance_target)
        elif self.index_type == "IVF_PQ":
            self.index = self._build_ivf_pq_index(vectors, n_vectors, performance_target)
        else:
            # Fallback to flat index for small datasets
            self.index = self._build_flat_index(vectors)
```

The factory pattern allows us to use the optimal indexing algorithm for each scenario while maintaining a consistent interface.

```python
        # Record performance metrics
        build_time = time.time() - build_start
        self.performance_metrics['build_time'] = build_time
        self.performance_metrics['vectors_per_second'] = n_vectors / build_time
```

We track build performance to optimize future indexing operations and provide feedback on the chosen algorithm's efficiency.

```python
        # Store ID mapping for result retrieval
        for i, external_id in enumerate(external_ids):
            self.id_map[i] = external_id

        print(f"Index built in {build_time:.1f}s "
              f"({n_vectors/build_time:.0f} vectors/sec)")
```

**Intelligent Index Selection Logic**

This method chooses the best algorithm based on dataset characteristics:

```python
    def _select_optimal_index(self, n_vectors: int, memory_gb: float,
                             target: str) -> str:
        """Intelligent index selection based on dataset characteristics.
        """
        # Small datasets: use exact search
        if n_vectors < 10000:
            return "Flat"
```

For small datasets, exact search (Flat index) provides perfect accuracy with minimal overhead. The crossover point is around 10,000 vectors.

```python
        # Speed priority with moderate memory
        if target == "speed" and memory_gb < 8.0:
            return "HNSW"

        # Memory constraints or very large datasets
        if target == "memory" or memory_gb > 16.0:
            return "IVF_PQ"

        # Accuracy priority
        if target == "accuracy":
            return "HNSW"
```

The decision matrix considers both performance targets and resource constraints. HNSW excels at speed and accuracy, while IVF+PQ optimizes for memory efficiency.

```python
        # Balanced approach based on scale
        if n_vectors > 1000000:
            return "IVF_PQ"  # Scale efficiency for large datasets
        else:
            return "HNSW"    # Performance consistency for medium datasets
```

**Step 8: IVF Index - Clustering for Scale**

**IVF Philosophy**: "Divide and conquer through intelligent clustering"

IVF excels when **memory efficiency and scalability** outweigh the need for ultra-low latency. The algorithm's strength lies in its ability to dramatically reduce search space through clustering.

**Key Performance Characteristics:**
- **Memory scaling**: O(n) with excellent compression via Product Quantization
- **Search complexity**: O(k + m) where k=clusters searched, m=vectors per cluster
- **Build time**: O(n * k) clustering cost, parallelizable
- **Update efficiency**: New vectors easily added to appropriate clusters

```python
    def _build_ivf_index(self, vectors: np.ndarray, n_vectors: int,
                        performance_target: str) -> faiss.Index:
        """Build IVF index with target-specific optimizations."""
        # Adaptive centroid selection based on dataset size and target
        if performance_target == "speed":
            centroid_ratio = 0.05  # Fewer clusters, faster search
        elif performance_target == "accuracy":
            centroid_ratio = 0.15  # More clusters, better partitioning
        else:
            centroid_ratio = 0.08  # Balanced approach

        n_centroids = max(32, min(65536, int(n_vectors * centroid_ratio)))
```

Centroid selection balances clustering quality with search speed. More centroids create better partitioning but require more clusters to search for high recall.

```python
        print(f"IVF Configuration: {n_centroids:,} centroids "
              f"(ratio: {centroid_ratio:.3f})")

        # Create quantizer (centroid index)
        quantizer = faiss.IndexFlatIP(self.dimension)
```

The quantizer creates the centroid index that will organize vectors into clusters. We use inner product (IP) for the quantizer.

```python
        # Choose IVF variant based on size
        if n_vectors > 100000:
            # Use Product Quantization for large datasets
            m = self._select_pq_segments(self.dimension)
            index = faiss.IndexIVFPQ(quantizer, self.dimension,
                                   n_centroids, m, 8)  # 8 bits per sub-vector
            print(f"Using IVF+PQ with {m} segments for compression")
        else:
            # Use flat storage for better accuracy on smaller datasets
            index = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(quantizer, self.dimension, n_centroids)
            print("Using IVFFlat for optimal accuracy")
```

For large datasets, Product Quantization provides significant memory compression. Smaller datasets use flat storage for optimal quality.

```python
        # Training phase - critical for clustering quality
        print("Training IVF centroids...")
        if n_vectors > 1000000:
            sample_size = min(1000000, n_vectors)
            sample_indices = np.random.choice(n_vectors, sample_size, replace=False)
            training_data = vectors[sample_indices]
            print(f"Using {sample_size:,} vectors for training")
        else:
            training_data = vectors

        index.train(training_data)
        print("Adding vectors to index...")
        index.add(vectors)
```

Training learns optimal cluster centroids. For very large datasets, we sample to balance training quality with build time.

```python
        # Set query parameters based on target
        if performance_target == "speed":
            index.nprobe = max(1, n_centroids // 32)  # Search fewer clusters
        elif performance_target == "accuracy":
            index.nprobe = min(n_centroids, n_centroids // 4)  # Search more clusters
        else:
            index.nprobe = max(8, n_centroids // 16)  # Balanced search

        print(f"IVF index ready: nprobe={index.nprobe} "
              f"({100*index.nprobe/n_centroids:.1f}% cluster coverage)")
        return index

    def _select_pq_segments(self, dimension: int) -> int:
        """Select optimal number of PQ segments for compression."""
        for m in [8, 16, 32, 64, 96, 128]:
            if dimension % m == 0 and m <= dimension // 2:
                return m
        return 8  # Safe fallback
```

**Step 9: HNSW - Graph Navigation for Speed**

**HNSW Philosophy**: "Navigate through similarity space like a GPS system"

HNSW creates a hierarchical graph where each vector connects to its most similar neighbors, enabling logarithmic search complexity through intelligent navigation.

**Key Performance Characteristics:**
- **Query latency**: Consistent sub-millisecond search times
- **Memory usage**: Higher than IVF (stores full vectors + graph connections)
- **Build complexity**: O(n log n) with parallel construction
- **Search complexity**: O(log n) expected, very consistent
- **Update challenge**: Graph modifications require careful rebalancing

```python
    def _build_hnsw_index(self, vectors: np.ndarray,
                         performance_target: str) -> faiss.Index:
        """Build HNSW index with target-specific parameter optimization."""
        # Parameter selection based on performance target
        if performance_target == "speed":
            M = 16           # Lower connectivity for speed
            ef_construct = 128   # Faster construction
            ef_search = 64       # Faster queries
        elif performance_target == "accuracy":
            M = 64           # High connectivity for best recall
            ef_construct = 512   # Thorough graph construction
            ef_search = 256      # High-accuracy searches
        else:
            M = 32           # Balanced connectivity
            ef_construct = 200   # Good graph quality
            ef_search = 128      # Balanced search
```

HNSW parameter selection creates distinct performance profiles. Higher M values increase memory usage but improve recall through better graph connectivity.

```python
        print(f"HNSW Configuration: M={M}, ef_construct={ef_construct}, "
              f"ef_search={ef_search}")

        # Create HNSW index
        index = faiss.IndexHNSWFlat(self.dimension, M)
        index.hnsw.efConstruction = ef_construct
```

We create the HNSW index with the selected parameters. The efConstruction parameter is set before adding vectors to ensure proper graph construction.

```python
        # Build the graph
        print("Building HNSW graph structure...")
        index.add(vectors)

        # Set search parameter
        index.hnsw.efSearch = ef_search
```

Graph construction builds the navigable small world structure. The efSearch parameter can be adjusted per query for different speed/accuracy trade-offs.

```python
        # Calculate memory usage for monitoring
        memory_per_vector = self.dimension * 4 + M * 4  # Float32 + connections
        total_memory_mb = (len(vectors) * memory_per_vector) / (1024**2)

        print(f"HNSW index ready: {len(vectors):,} vectors, "
              f"~{total_memory_mb:.1f}MB memory usage")
        return index
```

**Performance Comparison Summary:**

| **Metric** | **HNSW** | **IVF** | **IVF+PQ** |
|------------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Query Latency** | 0.1-1ms | 1-10ms | 2-20ms |
| **Memory Usage** | High | Medium | Low |
| **Build Time** | Medium | Fast | Medium |
| **Recall @10** | 95-99% | 85-95% | 80-90% |
| **Scalability** | 10M vectors | 100M+ vectors | 1B+ vectors |
| **Update Efficiency** | Complex | Good | Good |

**Practical Decision Guidelines:**
- **Choose HNSW when**: Latency <10ms required, memory available, high accuracy needed
- **Choose IVF when**: Moderate latency acceptable, frequent updates, balanced performance
- **Choose IVF+PQ when**: Memory constrained, massive scale (>10M vectors), cost-sensitive

### **Bridge to RAG Architecture: How Index Choice Impacts Retrieval Quality**

Your vector database and indexing choices cascade through every aspect of RAG performance. Understanding these connections helps you make informed architectural decisions:

**Impact on RAG Response Quality:**

1. **Index Recall ‚Üí Answer Accuracy**: Lower recall means missing relevant context, leading to incomplete or incorrect answers
   - **HNSW at 98% recall**: Nearly perfect context retrieval, high answer quality
   - **IVF+PQ at 85% recall**: Some context loss, but often acceptable for cost savings
   - **Rule of thumb**: 5% recall drop ‚âà 2-3% answer quality drop

2. **Query Latency ‚Üí User Experience**: Retrieval speed directly impacts perceived responsiveness
   - **<100ms**: Feels instantaneous, enables interactive conversations
   - **100-500ms**: Acceptable for most applications, slight delay noticeable
   - **>500ms**: Poor user experience, frustrating for interactive use

3. **Memory Usage ‚Üí Deployment Cost**: Index memory requirements affect infrastructure expenses
   - **HNSW**: $200-800/month per 1M vectors (depending on instance type)
   - **IVF+PQ**: $50-200/month per 1M vectors with compression
   - **Managed services**: Add 2-3x markup for convenience

**Optimizing the RAG Pipeline Stack:**

**RAG Architecture Optimization System**

This optimizer helps choose the right vector database based on specific RAG requirements:

```python
class RAGArchitectureOptimizer:
    """Optimize vector database choice based on RAG requirements.
    
    Analyzes performance, cost, and accuracy requirements to recommend
    the optimal vector database and indexing strategy for RAG systems.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def recommend_architecture(requirements: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Provide architecture recommendations based on RAG needs."""
        # Extract key requirements from user specifications
        query_volume = requirements.get('daily_queries', 1000)
        document_count = requirements.get('document_count', 100000)
        latency_requirement = requirements.get('max_latency_ms', 500)
        budget_constraint = requirements.get('monthly_budget_usd', 1000)
        accuracy_requirement = requirements.get('min_recall', 0.9)
```

**Initialize Recommendation Structure**

Set up the framework for delivering comprehensive architecture recommendations:

```python
        # Initialize recommendation structure
        recommendations = {
            'database': None,
            'index_type': None,
            'configuration': {},
            'expected_performance': {},
            'cost_estimate': {},
            'rationale': ''
        }
```

**High-Performance RAG Configuration**

For applications requiring ultra-low latency with adequate budget:

```python
        # High-performance RAG: Low latency + adequate budget
        if latency_requirement < 100 and budget_constraint > 500:
            recommendations.update({
                'database': 'Pinecone',
                'index_type': 'HNSW-based managed',
                'rationale': 'Ultra-low latency requirement with adequate budget',
                'configuration': {
                    'pods': 2,
                    'replicas': 1,
                    'pod_type': 'p1.x1'
                },
                'expected_performance': {
                    'p95_latency_ms': 50,
                    'recall_at_10': 0.96,
                    'qps_capacity': 5000
                }
            })
```

**Cost-Optimized RAG Configuration**

For large-scale deployments or budget-constrained environments:

```python
        elif document_count > 1000000 or budget_constraint < 200:
            # Cost-optimized RAG for scale or budget constraints
            recommendations.update({
                'database': 'Qdrant',
                'index_type': 'IVF+PQ',
                'rationale': 'Large scale or budget constraints favor compression',
                'configuration': {
                    'centroids': int(document_count * 0.08),
                    'pq_segments': 16,
                    'memory_mapping': True
                }
            })
```

For large-scale or budget-constrained deployments, Qdrant with IVF+PQ provides excellent compression and cost efficiency while maintaining reasonable performance.

```python
        else:
            # Balanced RAG for most applications
            recommendations.update({
                'database': 'ChromaDB',
                'index_type': 'HNSW',
                'rationale': 'Balanced performance for moderate-scale RAG',
                'configuration': {
                    'M': 16,
                    'ef_construction': 200,
                    'ef_search': 100
                },
                'expected_performance': {
                    'p95_latency_ms': 100,
                    'recall_at_10': 0.94,
                    'memory_gb': document_count * 0.3
                }
            })
        return recommendations
```

**Real-World RAG Performance Examples:**

**Scenario 1: Customer Support Chatbot**
- **Volume**: 10,000 queries/day, 500K documents
- **Requirement**: <200ms response time, 90%+ accuracy
- **Choice**: ChromaDB with HNSW (M=16, ef=128)
- **Result**: 95% recall, 80ms p95 latency, $150/month cost

**Scenario 2: Legal Document Search**
- **Volume**: 1,000 queries/day, 10M documents
- **Requirement**: High accuracy critical, budget constrained
- **Choice**: Qdrant with IVF+PQ compression
- **Result**: 91% recall, 300ms p95 latency, $400/month cost

**Scenario 3: Real-time Financial Analysis**
- **Volume**: 50,000 queries/day, 2M documents
- **Requirement**: <50ms latency, enterprise reliability
- **Choice**: Pinecone with optimized HNSW
- **Result**: 97% recall, 35ms p95 latency, $1,200/month cost

**Performance Tuning Cascade Effects:**

Understanding how database optimizations impact the entire RAG pipeline:

1. **Index Parameters ‚Üí Retrieval Quality ‚Üí Generation Accuracy**
   ```python
   # Example: HNSW parameter impact on RAG quality
   ef_values = [50, 100, 200, 400]
   quality_metrics = {
       50:  {'recall': 0.89, 'latency': '45ms', 'answer_accuracy': 0.82},
       100: {'recall': 0.94, 'latency': '80ms', 'answer_accuracy': 0.87},
       200: {'recall': 0.97, 'latency': '150ms', 'answer_accuracy': 0.91},
       400: {'recall': 0.98, 'latency': '280ms', 'answer_accuracy': 0.92}
   }
   # Sweet spot: ef=100-200 for most RAG applications
```

2. **Hybrid Search Weight Tuning ‚Üí Domain Adaptation**
   ```python
   # Domain-specific hybrid search optimization
   domain_weights = {
       'legal': {'semantic': 0.4, 'lexical': 0.6},    # Exact terms matter
       'customer_support': {'semantic': 0.7, 'lexical': 0.3},  # Intent matters
       'medical': {'semantic': 0.5, 'lexical': 0.5},   # Balanced approach
       'creative': {'semantic': 0.8, 'lexical': 0.2}   # Conceptual similarity
   }
```

This architectural understanding transforms you from someone who uses vector databases to someone who engineers optimal retrieval systems. The next session will build on these foundations to enhance query understanding and context augmentation.

### **Search Performance Optimization**

Implement caching and query optimization for production performance:

```python
# Search optimization with caching
from functools import lru_cache
import hashlib
import pickle
from typing import Optional

class OptimizedSearchEngine:
    """Production search engine with caching and optimization."""

    def __init__(self, vector_store, cache_size: int = 1000):
        self.vector_store = vector_store
        self.cache_size = cache_size
        self.query_cache = {}
        self.embedding_cache = {}

    @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
    def _get_query_embedding(self, query: str) -> Tuple[float, ...]:
        """Cache query embeddings to avoid recomputation."""
        embedding = self.vector_store.embedding_function.embed_query(query)
        return tuple(embedding)  # Hashable for LRU cache

    def optimized_search(self, query: str, top_k: int = 10,
                        filters: Optional[Dict] = None,
                        use_cache: bool = True) -> List[Dict]:
        """Optimized search with caching and preprocessing."""

        # Create cache key
        cache_key = self._create_cache_key(query, top_k, filters)

        # Check cache
        if use_cache and cache_key in self.query_cache:
            print("Cache hit!")
            return self.query_cache[cache_key]

        # Preprocess query
        processed_query = self._preprocess_query(query)

        # Get embedding (with caching)
        query_embedding = list(self._get_query_embedding(processed_query))

        # Perform search with optimizations
        results = self._search_with_optimizations(
            query_embedding, top_k, filters
        )

        # Cache results
        if use_cache and len(self.query_cache) < self.cache_size:
            self.query_cache[cache_key] = results

        return results
```

## **Part 4: Advanced Retrieval Techniques (30 minutes)**

### **Multi-Stage Retrieval Pipeline**

Implement sophisticated retrieval with multiple stages for optimal precision:

```python
# Multi-stage retrieval implementation
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Callable
import asyncio
import concurrent.futures

class MultiStageRetriever:
    """Advanced multi-stage retrieval pipeline."""

    def __init__(self, vector_store, reranker, query_enhancer):
        self.vector_store = vector_store
        self.reranker = reranker
        self.query_enhancer = query_enhancer

        # Retrieval stages configuration
        self.stages = [
            {'name': 'initial_retrieval', 'k': 100},
            {'name': 'keyword_filtering', 'k': 50},
            {'name': 'reranking', 'k': 20},
            {'name': 'final_filtering', 'k': 10}
        ]

    async def retrieve_multi_stage(self, query: str,
                                 target_k: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
        """Execute multi-stage retrieval pipeline."""

        # Stage 2: Parallel initial retrieval
        initial_results = await self._parallel_retrieval(enhanced_queries)

        # Stage 3: Merge and deduplicate results
        merged_results = self._merge_and_deduplicate(initial_results)

        # Stage 4: Apply progressive filtering
        filtered_results = await self._progressive_filtering(
            query, merged_results, target_k
        )

        return filtered_results
```

**Step 10: Query Enhancement for Retrieval**
```python
    async def _generate_query_variants(self, query: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Generate multiple query variants for comprehensive retrieval."""

        variants = []

        # Original query

        # Use your LLM here
        return query  # Simplified for example
```

**Step 11: Parallel Retrieval Execution**
```python
    async def _parallel_retrieval(self, query_variants: List[Dict]) -> List[List[Dict]]:
        """Execute retrieval for multiple query variants in parallel."""

        async def retrieve_single(variant: Dict) -> List[Dict]:

                variant['query'],
                k=self.stages[0]['k']
            )

            # Add variant metadata

        tasks = [retrieve_single(variant) for variant in query_variants]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

        return results
```

**Step 12: Advanced Result Merging**
```python
    def _merge_and_deduplicate(self, result_lists: List[List[Dict]]) -> List[Dict]:
        """Merge results from multiple retrievals with deduplication."""

        # Flatten all results
        all_results = []
        for result_list in result_lists:

            total_weight += weight

        if total_weight == 0:
            return 0.0

        # Boost score based on how many variants found this result
        variant_boost = min(len(result_group) * 0.1, 0.3)
        combined_score = (total_weighted_score / total_weight) + variant_boost

        return min(combined_score, 1.0)
```

### **Contextual Filtering and Ranking**

Implement sophisticated filtering based on context and user preferences:

```python
# Advanced filtering and ranking
class ContextualFilter:
    """Context-aware filtering and ranking system."""

    def __init__(self, llm_model):
        self.llm_model = llm_model
        self.filter_strategies = {
            'temporal': self._temporal_filter,
            'semantic_coherence': self._semantic_coherence_filter,
            'diversity': self._diversity_filter,
            'authority': self._authority_filter
        }

    def apply_contextual_filters(self, query: str, results: List[Dict],

        start_time = time.time()

        if search_type == "hybrid":
            results = self.hybrid_engine.hybrid_search(query, top_k)
