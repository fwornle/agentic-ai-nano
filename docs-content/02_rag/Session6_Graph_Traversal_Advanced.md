## Advanced Graph Traversal Algorithms

### Intelligent Breadth-First Traversal

Traditional BFS treats all paths equally, but intelligent traversal uses relevance scoring:

```python
class IntelligentGraphTraversal:
    """Advanced graph traversal with relevance-aware path exploration"""

    def __init__(self, graph, relevance_calculator):
        self.graph = graph
        self.relevance_calc = relevance_calculator
        self.visited_nodes = set()
        self.path_relevance_cache = {}
```

The relevance calculator enables the traversal algorithm to prioritize more promising paths during exploration.

```python
    def relevance_guided_bfs(self, start_nodes, query, max_hops=4,
                           min_relevance=0.3):
        """BFS with relevance-guided path exploration"""

        # Initialize priority queue with start nodes
        path_queue = PriorityQueue()

        for start_node in start_nodes:
            initial_relevance = self.relevance_calc.calculate_relevance(
                start_node, query
            )

            if initial_relevance >= min_relevance:
                path_queue.put((-initial_relevance, 0, [start_node]))
```

Priority queue ordering ensures most relevant paths are explored first, improving both efficiency and result quality.

```python
        relevant_paths = []

        while not path_queue.empty() and len(relevant_paths) < 100:
            neg_relevance, hops, current_path = path_queue.get()
            current_relevance = -neg_relevance
            current_node = current_path[-1]

            # Add current path to results if it meets criteria
            if hops > 0:  # Don't include single-node paths
                relevant_paths.append({
                    'path': current_path,
                    'relevance': current_relevance,
                    'hops': hops,
                    'end_node_type': self.graph.nodes[current_node].get('type')
                })

            # Explore neighbors if we haven't exceeded hop limit
            if hops < max_hops:
                self.explore_neighbors(
                    current_node, current_path, current_relevance,
                    hops, query, path_queue, min_relevance
                )

        return self.rank_and_filter_paths(relevant_paths)
```

### Advanced Neighbor Exploration

Neighbor exploration considers relationship types and path coherence:

```python
    def explore_neighbors(self, current_node, current_path,
                         current_relevance, hops, query,
                         path_queue, min_relevance):
        """Explore neighbors with relationship-aware scoring"""

        neighbors = list(self.graph.neighbors(current_node))

        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if neighbor in current_path:  # Avoid cycles
                continue

            # Calculate relationship strength
            edge_data = self.graph[current_node][neighbor]
            relationship_strength = edge_data.get('weight', 0.5)
            relationship_type = edge_data.get('type', 'unknown')
```

Relationship strength and type influence path scoring, ensuring semantically coherent traversal paths.

```python
            # Calculate neighbor relevance
            neighbor_relevance = self.relevance_calc.calculate_relevance(
                neighbor, query
            )

            # Calculate path coherence
            path_coherence = self.calculate_path_coherence(
                current_path + [neighbor]
            )

            # Combine relevance factors with decay
            hop_decay = 0.85 ** (hops + 1)  # Relevance decays with distance
            combined_relevance = (
                current_relevance * 0.6 +  # Previous path relevance
                neighbor_relevance * 0.3 +  # New node relevance
                path_coherence * 0.1       # Path coherence bonus
            ) * hop_decay * relationship_strength
```

The combined scoring approach balances multiple factors: existing path quality, new node relevance, and overall path coherence.

```python
            if combined_relevance >= min_relevance:
                new_path = current_path + [neighbor]
                path_queue.put((-combined_relevance, hops + 1, new_path))
```

### Path Coherence Calculation

Path coherence ensures traversal follows logical knowledge connections:

```python
    def calculate_path_coherence(self, path):
        """Calculate semantic coherence of a traversal path"""

        if len(path) < 2:
            return 1.0

        coherence_score = 0.0
        total_transitions = len(path) - 1

        for i in range(total_transitions):
            source_node = path[i]
            target_node = path[i + 1]

            # Get node types and relationship
            source_type = self.graph.nodes[source_node].get('type')
            target_type = self.graph.nodes[target_node].get('type')
            relationship = self.graph[source_node][target_node]
```

Coherence calculation examines each transition in the path to ensure logical flow between different knowledge elements.

```python
            # Calculate transition coherence based on type compatibility
            type_compatibility = self.get_type_compatibility(
                source_type, target_type, relationship.get('type')
            )

            # Consider semantic similarity between connected nodes
            semantic_similarity = self.calculate_semantic_similarity(
                source_node, target_node
            )

            # Weight factors for transition quality
            transition_score = (
                type_compatibility * 0.7 +
                semantic_similarity * 0.3
            )

            coherence_score += transition_score

        return coherence_score / total_transitions
```

### Multi-Hop Reasoning with Context Aggregation

Multi-hop reasoning requires aggregating information from diverse path contexts:

```python
class MultiHopReasoningEngine:
    """Advanced multi-hop reasoning with context synthesis"""

    def __init__(self, graph_traversal, context_aggregator):
        self.traversal = graph_traversal
        self.context_agg = context_aggregator
        self.reasoning_cache = {}
```

The reasoning engine combines graph traversal with sophisticated context aggregation for coherent multi-hop answers.

```python
    def reason_multi_hop(self, query, start_entities, max_reasoning_depth=5):
        """Perform multi-hop reasoning with context synthesis"""

        # Step 1: Find relevant reasoning paths
        reasoning_paths = self.traversal.relevance_guided_bfs(
            start_entities,
            query,
            max_hops=max_reasoning_depth
        )

        if not reasoning_paths:
            return self.fallback_reasoning(query, start_entities)
```

The fallback reasoning ensures the system can still provide useful responses even when graph traversal finds no relevant paths.

```python
        # Step 2: Group paths by reasoning patterns
        path_groups = self.group_paths_by_pattern(reasoning_paths)

        # Step 3: Synthesize evidence from each group
        synthesized_evidence = []

        for pattern, paths in path_groups.items():
            group_evidence = self.synthesize_path_group(
                paths, query, pattern
            )
            synthesized_evidence.append(group_evidence)
```

Path grouping enables the system to identify common reasoning patterns and synthesize evidence more effectively.

```python
        # Step 4: Generate coherent reasoning response
        reasoning_response = self.generate_reasoning_response(
            query, synthesized_evidence, reasoning_paths
        )

        return {
            'answer': reasoning_response,
            'reasoning_paths': reasoning_paths,
            'evidence_synthesis': synthesized_evidence,
            'confidence_score': self.calculate_reasoning_confidence(
                reasoning_paths, synthesized_evidence
            )
        }
```

### Path Pattern Recognition

Different query types require different reasoning patterns:

```python
    def group_paths_by_pattern(self, reasoning_paths):
        """Group paths by their reasoning patterns"""

        pattern_groups = {
            'causal_chains': [],      # A causes B causes C
            'attribute_paths': [],    # Entity -> Attribute -> Value
            'relationship_paths': [], # Entity1 -> Relationship -> Entity2
            'taxonomic_paths': [],    # Category -> Subcategory -> Instance
            'temporal_paths': []      # Event1 -> Temporal -> Event2
        }

        for path_info in reasoning_paths:
            path = path_info['path']
            pattern = self.identify_reasoning_pattern(path)

            if pattern in pattern_groups:
                pattern_groups[pattern].append(path_info)
            else:
                # Default to relationship paths for unknown patterns
                pattern_groups['relationship_paths'].append(path_info)

        return {k: v for k, v in pattern_groups.items() if v}  # Remove empty groups
```

Pattern recognition enables specialized processing for different types of logical connections.

### Advanced Context Synthesis

Context synthesis combines information from multiple paths into coherent explanations:

```python
    def synthesize_path_group(self, paths, query, pattern):
        """Synthesize evidence from paths sharing a reasoning pattern"""

        synthesis = {
            'pattern': pattern,
            'evidence_strength': 0.0,
            'supporting_paths': len(paths),
            'key_insights': [],
            'contradictions': []
        }

        # Extract key information from all paths in group
        all_evidence = []
        for path_info in paths:
            path_evidence = self.extract_path_evidence(
                path_info['path'], query
            )
            all_evidence.append(path_evidence)
```

Evidence extraction considers both the content of nodes and the relationships between them.

```python
        # Identify common insights across paths
        common_insights = self.find_common_insights(all_evidence)
        synthesis['key_insights'] = common_insights

        # Detect contradictory information
        contradictions = self.detect_contradictions(all_evidence)
        synthesis['contradictions'] = contradictions

        # Calculate evidence strength based on convergence
        synthesis['evidence_strength'] = self.calculate_evidence_strength(
            all_evidence, common_insights, contradictions
        )
```

Evidence strength calculation considers both the convergence of evidence and the presence of contradictions.

```python
        # Generate pattern-specific explanation
        if pattern == 'causal_chains':
            synthesis['explanation'] = self.explain_causal_reasoning(
                paths, common_insights
            )
        elif pattern == 'attribute_paths':
            synthesis['explanation'] = self.explain_attribute_reasoning(
                paths, common_insights
            )
        else:
            synthesis['explanation'] = self.explain_general_reasoning(
                paths, common_insights
            )

        return synthesis
```

## Advanced Response Generation

### Context-Aware Response Synthesis

The final step combines all reasoning evidence into a coherent response:

```python
    def generate_reasoning_response(self, query, synthesized_evidence,
                                  reasoning_paths):
        """Generate comprehensive response from reasoning evidence"""

        # Sort evidence by strength for priority in response
        sorted_evidence = sorted(
            synthesized_evidence,
            key=lambda x: x['evidence_strength'],
            reverse=True
        )

        response_components = {
            'direct_answer': self.generate_direct_answer(
                query, sorted_evidence
            ),
            'reasoning_explanation': self.generate_reasoning_explanation(
                sorted_evidence
            ),
            'supporting_evidence': self.format_supporting_evidence(
                reasoning_paths[:5]  # Top 5 most relevant paths
            ),
            'confidence_indicators': self.generate_confidence_indicators(
                sorted_evidence
            )
        }
```

Response components are structured to provide both direct answers and transparent reasoning explanations.

```python
        # Compose final response with appropriate structure
        if len(sorted_evidence) == 1:
            # Single reasoning pattern found
            response = self.compose_single_pattern_response(
                response_components, sorted_evidence[0]
            )
        else:
            # Multiple reasoning patterns - synthesize complex answer
            response = self.compose_multi_pattern_response(
                response_components, sorted_evidence
            )

        return response
```

### Confidence Calculation

Confidence calculation helps users understand the reliability of multi-hop reasoning:

```python
    def calculate_reasoning_confidence(self, reasoning_paths,
                                     synthesized_evidence):
        """Calculate confidence in multi-hop reasoning results"""

        if not reasoning_paths or not synthesized_evidence:
            return 0.0

        confidence_factors = {
            'path_diversity': self.calculate_path_diversity(reasoning_paths),
            'evidence_convergence': self.calculate_evidence_convergence(
                synthesized_evidence
            ),
            'source_quality': self.assess_source_quality(reasoning_paths),
            'reasoning_depth': self.assess_reasoning_depth(reasoning_paths),
            'contradiction_impact': self.assess_contradiction_impact(
                synthesized_evidence
            )
        }
```

Multiple confidence factors provide a comprehensive assessment of reasoning reliability.

```python
        # Weight different confidence factors
        weights = {
            'path_diversity': 0.25,
            'evidence_convergence': 0.30,
            'source_quality': 0.20,
            'reasoning_depth': 0.15,
            'contradiction_impact': 0.10
        }

        weighted_confidence = sum(
            confidence_factors[factor] * weights[factor]
            for factor in confidence_factors
        )

        # Apply confidence boosters and penalties
        if len(reasoning_paths) >= 5:
            weighted_confidence *= 1.1  # Multiple paths boost confidence

        if any(ev['contradictions'] for ev in synthesized_evidence):
            weighted_confidence *= 0.9  # Contradictions reduce confidence

        return min(1.0, max(0.0, weighted_confidence))  # Clamp to [0,1]
```

## Performance Optimization for Large Graphs

### Caching and Memoization

Large-scale graph traversal requires sophisticated caching strategies:

```python
class PerformanceOptimizedTraversal:
    """High-performance graph traversal with advanced caching"""

    def __init__(self, graph, cache_size=10000):
        self.graph = graph

        # Multi-level caching system
        self.path_cache = LRUCache(cache_size)
        self.relevance_cache = LRUCache(cache_size * 2)
        self.coherence_cache = LRUCache(cache_size // 2)

        # Precomputed indices for common access patterns
        self.type_indices = self.build_type_indices()
        self.relationship_indices = self.build_relationship_indices()
```

Multi-level caching optimizes different aspects of traversal computation with appropriate cache sizes for each use case.

```python
    def cached_relevance_calculation(self, node, query):
        """Calculate relevance with caching for repeated queries"""

        cache_key = (node, hash(query))

        if cache_key in self.relevance_cache:
            return self.relevance_cache[cache_key]

        # Perform expensive relevance calculation
        relevance_score = self.compute_relevance_score(node, query)

        self.relevance_cache[cache_key] = relevance_score
        return relevance_score
```

### Parallel Path Exploration

For large graphs, parallel exploration significantly improves performance:

```python
    def parallel_path_exploration(self, start_nodes, query, max_hops=4):
        """Explore multiple paths in parallel for better performance"""

        from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed

        # Divide start nodes among threads
        thread_count = min(8, len(start_nodes))  # Cap thread count
        node_chunks = self.chunk_nodes(start_nodes, thread_count)

        all_paths = []

        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=thread_count) as executor:
            # Submit exploration tasks
            future_to_chunk = {
                executor.submit(
                    self.explore_node_chunk,
                    chunk, query, max_hops
                ): chunk
                for chunk in node_chunks
            }

            # Collect results as they complete
            for future in as_completed(future_to_chunk):
                chunk_paths = future.result()
                all_paths.extend(chunk_paths)

        # Merge and deduplicate results
        return self.merge_and_deduplicate_paths(all_paths)
```

Parallel exploration must carefully handle shared state and result merging to maintain correctness while improving performance.

### Graph Preprocessing for Query Optimization

Strategic preprocessing can dramatically improve query performance:

```python
    def preprocess_graph_for_queries(self):
        """Preprocess graph structure for optimized query performance"""

        # Build inverted indices for common query patterns
        self.entity_to_attributes = defaultdict(list)
        self.attribute_to_entities = defaultdict(list)
        self.relationship_to_pairs = defaultdict(list)

        for node, node_data in self.graph.nodes(data=True):
            node_type = node_data.get('type')

            if node_type == 'entity':
                # Index entity attributes
                for neighbor in self.graph.neighbors(node):
                    neighbor_data = self.graph.nodes[neighbor]
                    if neighbor_data.get('type') == 'attribute':
                        self.entity_to_attributes[node].append(neighbor)
                        self.attribute_to_entities[neighbor].append(node)
```

Inverted indices enable fast lookup of common query patterns without full graph traversal.

```python
        # Build relationship shortcuts for frequent patterns
        self.frequent_patterns = self.identify_frequent_patterns()
        self.pattern_shortcuts = {}

        for pattern in self.frequent_patterns:
            if pattern['frequency'] > 100:  # Only cache very frequent patterns
                shortcuts = self.build_pattern_shortcuts(pattern)
                self.pattern_shortcuts[pattern['signature']] = shortcuts
```

Pattern shortcuts provide direct access to frequently traversed paths, eliminating redundant computation.

## Advanced Error Handling and Robustness

### Graceful Degradation

Complex graph traversal must handle various failure modes gracefully:

```python
    def robust_multi_hop_reasoning(self, query, start_entities,
                                 max_attempts=3):
        """Multi-hop reasoning with robust error handling"""

        for attempt in range(max_attempts):
            try:
                # Attempt full multi-hop reasoning
                result = self.reason_multi_hop(query, start_entities)

                if self.validate_reasoning_quality(result):
                    return result
                else:
                    # Quality check failed - try with adjusted parameters
                    if attempt < max_attempts - 1:
                        start_entities = self.expand_start_entities(start_entities)
                        continue

            except GraphTraversalTimeout:
                # Reduce complexity and try again
                if attempt < max_attempts - 1:
                    max_hops = max(1, self.max_hops - attempt)
                    continue

            except InsufficientGraphData:
                # Fall back to simpler reasoning
                return self.simple_reasoning_fallback(query, start_entities)

        # All attempts failed - return best-effort result
        return self.generate_fallback_response(query, start_entities)
```

Robust error handling ensures the system provides useful responses even when optimal graph traversal fails.
