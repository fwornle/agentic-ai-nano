## 📚 Advanced Document Analytics Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Document Complexity Scoring**

First, let's set up the foundation for document complexity analysis. This involves importing the necessary libraries and defining our data structures:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import Dict, List, Any
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class DocumentComplexityScore:
    structural_complexity: float
    semantic_complexity: float
    processing_difficulty: float
    overall_score: float
    recommendations: List[str]
```

The `DocumentComplexityScore` dataclass encapsulates all the metrics we need to evaluate how challenging a document will be to process. This structured approach helps RAG systems make informed decisions about chunking strategies and processing resources.

Next, we'll implement the main analyzer class that orchestrates the complexity assessment:

```python
class DocumentComplexityAnalyzer:
    """Analyze document complexity for optimal processing strategy selection."""
    
    def analyze_complexity(self, document: str) -> DocumentComplexityScore:
        """Comprehensive document complexity analysis."""
        
        # Structural complexity analysis
        structural_score = self._analyze_structural_complexity(document)
        
        # Semantic complexity analysis
        semantic_score = self._analyze_semantic_complexity(document)
        
        # Processing difficulty assessment
        processing_score = self._assess_processing_difficulty(document)
        
        # Overall complexity score
        overall_score = np.mean([structural_score, semantic_score, processing_score])
```

The analysis method coordinates three distinct complexity assessments to build a comprehensive understanding of document processing requirements.

Next, we generate recommendations and return the complete analysis:

```python
        # Generate processing recommendations
        recommendations = self._generate_recommendations(
            structural_score, semantic_score, processing_score
        )
        
        return DocumentComplexityScore(
            structural_complexity=structural_score,
            semantic_complexity=semantic_score,
            processing_difficulty=processing_score,
            overall_score=overall_score,
            recommendations=recommendations
        )
```

This main analysis method demonstrates the multi-dimensional approach to document complexity. By separately evaluating structural, semantic, and processing aspects, we can provide nuanced recommendations for optimal document handling.

Now let's implement the structural complexity analysis, which examines the document's format and organization:

```python
    def _analyze_structural_complexity(self, document: str) -> float:
        """Analyze structural complexity based on document elements."""
        complexity_factors = 0.0
        
        # Count different structural elements
        table_count = document.count('|')
        code_block_count = document.count('```')
        list_count = document.count('- ') + document.count('* ')
        heading_count = document.count('#')
        
        # Calculate complexity based on element density
        doc_length = len(document)
        if doc_length > 0:
            complexity_factors += (table_count / doc_length) * 100  # Tables add complexity
            complexity_factors += (code_block_count / doc_length) * 50  # Code blocks
            complexity_factors += (list_count / doc_length) * 20  # Lists
            complexity_factors += (heading_count / doc_length) * 30  # Hierarchical structure
        
        return min(complexity_factors, 1.0)  # Normalize to 0-1
```

### **Pattern 2: Content Quality Assessment**

Structural complexity analysis identifies documents with complex formatting that may require specialized chunking strategies. Tables, code blocks, and hierarchical structures each present unique challenges for content preservation during chunking.

### **Pattern 2: Content Quality Assessment**

After understanding document complexity, we need to evaluate the quality of our chunking results. This ensures that our processing maintains the content's educational and informational value:

```python
class ContentQualityAnalyzer:
    """Assess content quality for chunking optimization."""
    
    def assess_chunk_quality(self, chunks: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Comprehensive chunk quality assessment."""
        
        quality_metrics = {
            "coherence": self._measure_coherence(chunks),
            "information_density": self._measure_information_density(chunks),
            "readability": self._measure_readability(chunks),
            "completeness": self._measure_completeness(chunks)
        }
        
        # Overall quality score
        quality_metrics["overall_quality"] = np.mean(list(quality_metrics.values()))
        
        return quality_metrics
```

This quality assessment framework evaluates multiple dimensions of chunk quality. The balanced approach ensures that chunks maintain semantic coherence while preserving information density and readability.

Let's examine how coherence measurement works between adjacent chunks:

```python
    def _measure_coherence(self, chunks: List[str]) -> float:
        """Measure semantic coherence between chunks."""
        if len(chunks) < 2:
            return 1.0
            
        coherence_scores = []
        for i in range(len(chunks) - 1):
            score = self._calculate_similarity(chunks[i], chunks[i + 1])
            coherence_scores.append(score)
            
        return np.mean(coherence_scores)
```

Coherence measurement ensures that adjacent chunks maintain topical similarity, preventing abrupt context switches that could confuse retrieval systems and end users.

Now we'll implement information density analysis, which measures how much unique information each chunk contains:

```python
    def _measure_information_density(self, chunks: List[str]) -> float:
        """Measure information density in chunks."""
        densities = []
        
        for chunk in chunks:
            words = chunk.split()
            unique_words = set(words)
            
            if len(words) > 0:
                density = len(unique_words) / len(words)
                densities.append(density)
        
        return np.mean(densities) if densities else 0.0
```

### **Pattern 3: Domain-Specific Processing**

Information density analysis helps identify chunks that are either too sparse (low information value) or too dense (potentially overwhelming). This balance is crucial for effective retrieval and comprehension.

Different domains require specialized processing approaches. Legal documents, medical records, and technical documentation each have unique structures and terminology that affect optimal chunking strategies:

```python
class DomainSpecificProcessor:
    """Domain-aware document processing strategies."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.domain_patterns = {
            "legal": {
                "section_markers": ["§", "Article", "Section", "Clause"],
                "citation_patterns": [r'\d+\s+U\.S\.C\.\s+§\s+\d+', r'\d+\s+F\.\d+d\s+\d+'],
                "special_handling": ["definitions", "whereas", "therefore"]
            },
            "medical": {
                "section_markers": ["History", "Examination", "Assessment", "Plan"],
                "terminology_patterns": [r'[A-Z]{2,}', r'\d+mg', r'\d+ml'],
                "special_handling": ["medications", "dosages", "contraindications"]
            },
```

The domain patterns define the structural and terminology markers that characterize different document types.

We continue with technical domain patterns:

```python
            "technical": {
                "section_markers": ["Prerequisites", "Procedure", "Examples", "Notes"],
                "code_patterns": [r'```[\s\S]*?```', r'`[^`]+`'],
                "special_handling": ["code_blocks", "api_references", "commands"]
            }
        }
```

This domain configuration defines the specific patterns and structures that characterize different document types. Understanding these patterns enables more intelligent chunking that preserves domain-specific relationships and terminology.

Now let's implement the main processing method that applies domain-specific rules:

```python
    def process_domain_document(self, document: str, domain: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Process document with domain-specific rules."""
        
        if domain not in self.domain_patterns:
            domain = "general"
            
        domain_config = self.domain_patterns.get(domain, {})
        
        # Extract domain-specific elements
        sections = self._extract_domain_sections(document, domain_config)
        terminology = self._extract_domain_terminology(document, domain_config)
        special_elements = self._handle_special_elements(document, domain_config)
```

The processing method applies domain-specific extraction rules to identify and preserve important structural elements.

Finally, we compile the results and recommend an optimal processing strategy:

```python
        return {
            "domain": domain,
            "sections": sections,
            "terminology": terminology,
            "special_elements": special_elements,
            "processing_strategy": self._recommend_strategy(domain, sections)
        }
```

Domain-specific processing recognizes that different types of documents require tailored approaches. Legal documents need careful handling of citations and statutory references, medical records require attention to dosages and medical terminology, and technical documents must preserve code blocks and API references. This specialized processing significantly improves retrieval accuracy and preserves critical contextual relationships.
