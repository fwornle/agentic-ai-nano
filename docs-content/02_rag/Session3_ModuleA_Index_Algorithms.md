# Session 3 - Module A: Index Algorithms

> **‚ö†Ô∏è ADVANCED OPTIONAL MODULE**
> Prerequisites: Complete Session 3 core content first.

You've implemented production-grade vector search with HNSW indexing and hybrid search in Session 3. But when your RAG system scales to millions of documents with specialized domain requirements, you hit the limits of generic vector databases. Off-the-shelf solutions optimize for general similarity search, not the unique patterns of question-answering workloads.

This module teaches you to implement custom indexing algorithms that understand RAG-specific needs: semantic clustering for topic-focused retrieval, dynamic parameter optimization that adapts to query patterns, and multi-signal ranking that combines semantic similarity with keyword matching and recency weighting. These aren't just performance optimizations ‚Äì they're intelligence upgrades that make your system fundamentally better at finding the right information for generation.
