## Session Introduction

In Session 1, you implemented a working RAG system that splits documents into manageable chunks. But that's where many RAG implementations stop ‚Äì and where they start to fail in production. When your chunker encounters a table and splits it down the middle, or breaks apart a code block that loses meaning without its function definition, you've hit the fundamental limitation of naive text splitting.

This session transforms your RAG system from simple text splitters into intelligent document understanding engines. You'll implement structure-aware chunking that preserves document hierarchy, extract rich metadata that enhances retrieval precision, and handle complex content types including tables, code blocks, and domain-specific formatting. The goal is to ensure that every chunk carries not just content, but context.

## üéØ Observer Path: Core Concepts Overview

### The Challenge with Naive Chunking

Standard text splitting destroys document structure:

- **Tables broken mid-row**: Revenue data becomes meaningless  
- **Code blocks fragmented**: Function definitions lose context  
- **Headings separated**: Topics lose their organizational hierarchy  
- **Lists split arbitrarily**: Enumerated items lose sequence  

Advanced chunking solves these problems by understanding document structure before making splitting decisions.

### Core Processing Stages

Intelligent document preprocessing follows four key stages:

1. **Structure Analysis**: Identify content types (headings, tables, code)  
2. **Hierarchical Chunking**: Respect document organization and relationships  
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Add context through entities, keywords, topics  
4. **Quality Assessment**: Measure and optimize chunk effectiveness  

For detailed implementation, continue to the üìù Participant path below.

### Basic Content Type Detection Example

Here's a simple example of how content type detection works:

```python
from enum import Enum

class ContentType(Enum):
    HEADING = "heading"
    PARAGRAPH = "paragraph"
    TABLE = "table"
    CODE = "code"
    LIST = "list"
```

This enumeration defines the basic content types our system needs to recognize.

```python
def detect_content_type(text_line):
    """Detect content type from a single line."""
    text = text_line.strip()

    # Check for markdown heading
    if text.startswith('#'):
        return ContentType.HEADING

    # Check for table (pipe-separated)
    if '|' in text and text.count('|') >= 2:
        return ContentType.TABLE
```

The detection logic examines text patterns to classify content. Markdown headers start with '#' symbols, while tables use '|' characters as column separators.

```python
    # Check for code (indentation)
    if text.startswith('    ') or text.startswith('\t'):
        return ContentType.CODE

    # Check for list item
    if text.startswith('- ') or text.startswith('* '):
        return ContentType.LIST

    return ContentType.PARAGRAPH
```

Code blocks are identified by indentation (4 spaces or tabs), list items by bullet markers, and everything else defaults to paragraph content.

### Document Element Structure

Structured representation preserves content relationships:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Dict, Any

@dataclass
class DocumentElement:
    """Structured document element."""
    content: str
    element_type: ContentType
    level: int
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    position: int
```

This structure captures content, type, hierarchy level, and metadata for each document element.

```python
    def get_hierarchy_context(self):
        """Get readable hierarchy info."""
        hierarchy_labels = {
            0: "Document Root",
            1: "Major Section",
            2: "Subsection"
        }
        return hierarchy_labels.get(self.level)
```

The hierarchy context method provides human-readable descriptions of element levels in the document structure.

### Hierarchical Chunking Fundamentals

The key insight of hierarchical chunking is respecting document structure rather than treating all text equally. Documents have natural boundaries:

- **Headings** introduce new topics  
- **Paragraphs** develop those topics  
- **Sections** relate hierarchically  

For detailed implementation guide:
üìù **[Hierarchical Chunking Practice ‚Üí](Session2_Hierarchical_Chunking_Practice.md)**

### Simple Chunking Example

Here's the core concept demonstrated with a basic implementation:

```python
def simple_hierarchical_chunk(elements, max_size=500):
    """Create structure-aware chunks."""
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_size = 0
```

The chunker maintains a current chunk and tracks its size while processing document elements.

```python
    for element in elements:
        element_size = len(element.content)

        # Start new chunk on major headings
        if (element.element_type == ContentType.HEADING
            and element.level <= 1 and current_chunk):

            chunks.append('\n'.join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = []
            current_size = 0
```

Major headings (level 0-1) trigger new chunks, preserving topic boundaries rather than splitting arbitrarily.

```python
        # Add element if size permits
        if current_size + element_size <= max_size:
            current_chunk.append(element.content)
            current_size += element_size
        else:
            # Finalize current, start new chunk
            if current_chunk:
                chunks.append('\n'.join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = [element.content]
            current_size = element_size

    return chunks
```

Size management ensures chunks remain manageable while preferring structural boundaries over arbitrary cuts.

### Key Benefits

- **Natural boundaries**: Respects document organization  
- **Complete sections**: Keeps related content together  
- **Size management**: Balances structure with practical limits
