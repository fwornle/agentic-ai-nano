# Session 2: Advanced Chunking & Preprocessing

In Session 1, you implemented a working RAG system that splits documents into manageable chunks. But that's where many RAG implementations stop – and where they start to fail in production. When your chunker encounters a table and splits it down the middle, or breaks apart a code block that loses meaning without its function definition, you've hit the fundamental limitation of naive text splitting.

This session transforms your RAG system from simple text splitters into intelligent document understanding engines. You'll implement structure-aware chunking that preserves document hierarchy, extract rich metadata that enhances retrieval precision, and handle complex content types including tables, code blocks, and domain-specific formatting. The goal is to ensure that every chunk carries not just content, but context.

## Part 1: Document Structure Analysis - Understanding Content Before Chunking

### Content Type Detection

The first step in advanced chunking is understanding what you're working with. Different content types have different semantic boundaries and preservation requirements. A heading-paragraph relationship needs different treatment than a table with structured data, and code blocks require completely different handling than prose text.

Let's start with content type detection that goes beyond simple pattern matching:

```python

# Simple content type detection

from enum import Enum

class ContentType(Enum):
    HEADING = "heading"
    PARAGRAPH = "paragraph" 
    TABLE = "table"
    CODE = "code"
    LIST = "list"

def detect_simple_content_type(text_line):
    """Detect content type from a single line of text."""
    text = text_line.strip()
    
    # Check for markdown heading
    if text.startswith('#'):
        return ContentType.HEADING
    
    # Check for table (pipe-separated)
    if '|' in text and text.count('|') >= 2:
        return ContentType.TABLE
        
    # Check for code (starts with 4 spaces or tab)
    if text.startswith('    ') or text.startswith('\t'):
        return ContentType.CODE
        
    # Check for list item
    if text.startswith('- ') or text.startswith('* '):
        return ContentType.LIST
        
    return ContentType.PARAGRAPH
```

**Code Explanation:**

- **Lines 12-14**: Detects markdown headings by looking for the '#' symbol
- **Lines 16-18**: Identifies tables by counting pipe characters ('|') that separate columns
- **Lines 20-22**: Recognizes code blocks by indentation patterns
- **Lines 24-26**: Spots list items by bullet point markers

This classification enables our system to make intelligent decisions about how to process each type of content.

### Building Document Elements

Now that we can classify content types, we need to represent document structure in a way that preserves relationships between elements. This structured approach will enable our chunker to make intelligent decisions about where to split and how to maintain context:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Dict, Any

@dataclass
class DocumentElement:
    """Represents a structured document element with metadata."""
    content: str
    element_type: ContentType
    level: int  # Hierarchy level (0=top, 1=section, 2=subsection)
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    position: int  # Position in document
    
    def get_hierarchy_context(self):
        """Get human-readable hierarchy information."""
        hierarchy_labels = {
            0: "Document Root",
            1: "Major Section", 
            2: "Subsection",
            3: "Minor Section"
        }
        return hierarchy_labels.get(self.level, f"Level {self.level}")
```

**Implementation Benefits:**

- **Structured representation**: Each element carries its content, type, and context
- **Hierarchy tracking**: Level information enables structure-aware processing
- **Rich metadata**: Position and additional context for enhanced chunking
- **Processing intelligence**: Different element types can receive specialized handling

With our document element structure defined, we can now implement the analyzer that transforms raw text into structured document understanding. This analyzer will be the foundation for all subsequent intelligent processing:

### Document Structure Analyzer - Pattern Recognition

```python
class DocumentStructureAnalyzer:
    """Analyzes document structure and content types."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.heading_patterns = [
            r'^#{1,6}\s+(.+)$',      # Markdown headers
            r'^([A-Z][^a-z]*)\s*$',  # ALL CAPS headers
            r'^\d+\.\s+(.+)$',       # Numbered headers
        ]
```

The analyzer initializes with patterns that recognize different heading styles. Markdown headers (# ## ###) are most common, but ALL CAPS and numbered headings appear in formal documents. These patterns enable the system to understand document hierarchy regardless of formatting conventions.

### Line-by-Line Document Analysis

```python
    def analyze_structure(self, document_text: str) -> List[DocumentElement]:
        """Analyze document structure and create structured elements."""
        lines = document_text.split('\n')
        elements = []
        current_level = 0
        position = 0

        for i, line in enumerate(lines):
            if not line.strip():
                continue

            content_type = detect_simple_content_type(line)
            level = self._determine_level(line, current_level, content_type)
```

The analysis process examines each non-empty line, classifying its content type and determining its hierarchical level. The level tracking enables understanding of document structure - when a heading appears, we know whether it's a section, subsection, or peer to the previous content.

### Element Creation with Rich Metadata

```python
            element = DocumentElement(
                content=line.strip(),
                element_type=content_type,
                level=level,
                metadata={
                    "line_number": i + 1,
                    "char_count": len(line),
                    "word_count": len(line.split())
                },
                position=position
            )
            
            elements.append(element)
            position += 1
            current_level = level

        return elements
```

Each document element captures not just content and type, but also position information and basic statistics. The line number enables precise error reporting, while character and word counts support size-based chunking decisions. This rich representation forms the foundation for intelligent chunking.

This analyzer creates a structured representation of the document that preserves hierarchy and content relationships. Notice how we're not just splitting text – we're understanding it.

### Advanced Pattern Recognition

For enterprise applications, you often encounter domain-specific documents with specialized formatting conventions. Legal documents have section markers and citations, medical documents have dosages and medications, and technical documents have API references and version numbers. Generic pattern matching isn't sufficient:

### Advanced Document Analyzer - Domain-Specific Intelligence

```python
import re
from typing import List, Tuple

class AdvancedDocumentAnalyzer:
    """Enterprise-grade document analysis with domain-specific patterns."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.domain_patterns = {
            "legal": {
                "section_markers": [r"§\s*\d+", r"Article\s+[IVX]+", r"Section\s+\d+"],
                "citations": [r"\d+\s+U\.S\.C\.\s+§\s+\d+", r"\d+\s+F\.\d+d\s+\d+"]
            },
            "medical": {
                "dosages": [r"\d+\s*mg", r"\d+\s*ml", r"\d+\s*cc"],
                "medications": [r"[A-Z][a-z]+(?:in|ol|ide|ine)"]
            },
            "technical": {
                "apis": [r"[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]+\(\)", r"HTTP[S]?\://"],
                "versions": [r"v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+", r"version\s+\d+"]
            }
        }
```

The advanced analyzer includes domain-specific pattern libraries that recognize specialized terminology and formatting. Legal patterns detect section references and case citations, medical patterns identify dosages and medication names, and technical patterns recognize API calls and version numbers. This domain knowledge enables intelligent processing decisions.

### Intelligent Analysis with Domain Context

```python
    def analyze_with_domain_knowledge(self, document_text: str, 
                                    domain: str = "general") -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Analyze document with domain-specific intelligence."""
        analysis = {
            "domain": domain,
            "structure": self._analyze_structure(document_text),
            "complexity_score": self._calculate_complexity_score(document_text),
            "processing_strategy": "standard"
        }
        
        if domain in self.domain_patterns:
            domain_features = self._extract_domain_features(document_text, domain)
            analysis["domain_features"] = domain_features
            analysis["processing_strategy"] = self._recommend_strategy(domain_features)
            
        return analysis
```

Domain-aware analysis combines general document structure understanding with specialized feature detection. When domain patterns match content, the system extracts domain-specific features and recommends appropriate processing strategies. This enables optimal handling of specialized documents without manual configuration.

This advanced analyzer adapts to different document domains and provides intelligent processing recommendations. The domain-specific patterns enable the system to recognize specialized content and adjust processing accordingly.

## Part 2: Hierarchical Chunking Implementation - Respecting Document Structure

The fundamental problem with naive chunking is that it treats all text equally. But documents have inherent structure: headings introduce topics, paragraphs develop those topics, and sections relate to each other hierarchically. Hierarchical chunking respects these natural boundaries, cutting along semantic divisions rather than arbitrary character counts.

This isn't just about better boundaries – it's about preserving the logical flow of information that makes chunks genuinely useful for retrieval.

### Simple Hierarchical Chunking

Here's a basic example of how hierarchical chunking works:

### Hierarchical Chunking Logic - Boundary Detection

```python
def simple_hierarchical_chunk(elements: List[DocumentElement], 
                            max_chunk_size: int = 500) -> List[str]:
    """Create simple hierarchical chunks based on document structure."""
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_size = 0
    
    for element in elements:
        element_size = len(element.content)
        
        # Start new chunk on major headings if current chunk has content
        if (element.element_type == ContentType.HEADING and 
            element.level <= 1 and current_chunk):
            
            # Save current chunk
            if current_chunk:
                chunks.append('\n'.join(current_chunk))
                current_chunk = []
                current_size = 0
```

The hierarchical boundary detection identifies natural breakpoints in documents. Major headings (level 0-1) signal topic transitions, making them ideal chunk boundaries. This preserves logical content groupings unlike arbitrary character-based splitting.

### Size Management with Structure Respect

```python
        # Add element to current chunk if size permits
        if current_size + element_size <= max_chunk_size:
            current_chunk.append(element.content)
            current_size += element_size
        else:
            # Save current chunk and start new one
            if current_chunk:
                chunks.append('\n'.join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = [element.content]
            current_size = element_size
    
    # Save final chunk
    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append('\n'.join(current_chunk))
    
    return chunks
```

Size management balances structure respect with practical constraints. Elements are accumulated until size limits are reached, then chunks are finalized. The approach prefers structural boundaries but respects size constraints when necessary, ensuring chunks remain manageable for processing and retrieval.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Natural boundaries**: Uses document structure instead of arbitrary splits
- **Complete sections**: Keeps related content together
- **Size management**: Respects maximum chunk size while preserving structure

### Advanced Hierarchical Chunker

The simple approach demonstrates the concept, but production systems need more sophisticated handling of edge cases, overlap management, and metadata preservation. Our advanced chunker addresses these requirements:

### Hierarchical Chunker - Core Initialization

Let's start with the chunker's initialization and main entry point:

```python
from langchain.schema import Document

class HierarchicalChunker:
    """Creates intelligent chunks based on document hierarchy."""

    def __init__(self, max_chunk_size: int = 1000, overlap_ratio: float = 0.1):
        self.max_chunk_size = max_chunk_size
        self.overlap_ratio = overlap_ratio
        self.analyzer = DocumentStructureAnalyzer()
```

The hierarchical chunker initializes with configurable parameters for chunk size and overlap. The overlap_ratio (typically 0.1 = 10%) ensures continuity between chunks by including some content from the previous chunk in the next one. This prevents context loss at chunk boundaries, which is crucial for maintaining semantic coherence.

```python
    def create_hierarchical_chunks(self, document: Document) -> List[Document]:
        """Create chunks that preserve document hierarchy."""
        # Analyze document structure
        elements = self.analyzer.analyze_structure(document.page_content)
        
        # Group elements into logical sections
        sections = self._group_elements_by_hierarchy(elements)
        
        # Create chunks from sections
        chunks = []
        for section in sections:
            section_chunks = self._chunk_section(section, document.metadata)
            chunks.extend(section_chunks)
        
        return chunks
```

This main method orchestrates the three-step chunking process: analyze structure, group by hierarchy, and create chunks. Notice how we preserve the original document metadata throughout the process - this ensures each chunk maintains its provenance and context information.

### Section Grouping Logic

The heart of hierarchical chunking is understanding document structure:

```python
    def _group_elements_by_hierarchy(self, elements: List[DocumentElement]) -> List[List[DocumentElement]]:
        """Group elements into hierarchical sections."""
        sections = []
        current_section = []
        current_level = -1

        for element in elements:
            # Start new section on same or higher level heading
            if (element.element_type == ContentType.HEADING and
                element.level <= current_level and current_section):
                sections.append(current_section)
                current_section = [element]
                current_level = element.level
```

This logic implements the core hierarchical principle: start a new section when you encounter a heading at the same level or higher (closer to root) than the current section. This respects document hierarchy - a new "## Introduction" section should close any previous "### Details" subsection.

```python
            elif element.element_type == ContentType.HEADING and not current_section:
                current_section = [element]
                current_level = element.level
            else:
                current_section.append(element)

        # Add final section
        if current_section:
            sections.append(current_section)

        return sections
```

The grouping logic handles edge cases: the first heading initializes the first section, and we ensure the final section isn't lost. This creates logical document sections that can be processed independently while maintaining their internal structure.

### Intelligent Section Chunking

Once sections are identified, we chunk them with size management and overlap:

```python
    def _chunk_section(self, section: List[DocumentElement], 
                      base_metadata: Dict) -> List[Document]:
        """Create chunks from a document section with intelligent overlap."""
        chunks = []
        current_chunk_elements = []
        current_size = 0
        
        section_title = self._extract_section_title(section)

        for element in section:
            element_size = len(element.content)

            # Check if adding this element would exceed size limit
            if current_size + element_size > self.max_chunk_size and current_chunk_elements:
```

This method balances structure preservation with size constraints. We track both the elements and their cumulative size, making decisions based on content boundaries rather than arbitrary character counts. The section title extraction provides context for each chunk.

```python
                # Create chunk from current elements
                chunk = self._create_chunk_from_elements(
                    current_chunk_elements, base_metadata, section_title
                )
                chunks.append(chunk)

                # Start new chunk with overlap for continuity
                overlap_elements = self._get_overlap_elements(current_chunk_elements)
                current_chunk_elements = overlap_elements + [element]
                current_size = sum(len(e.content) for e in current_chunk_elements)
```

When a size limit is reached, we create a chunk and start the next one with intelligent overlap. The overlap elements typically include the last few sentences or the section heading, ensuring context continuity. This prevents information loss at chunk boundaries.

```python
            else:
                current_chunk_elements.append(element)
                current_size += element_size

        # Create final chunk
        if current_chunk_elements:
            chunk = self._create_chunk_from_elements(
                current_chunk_elements, base_metadata, section_title
            )
            chunks.append(chunk)

        return chunks
```

The method handles the accumulation case (element fits in current chunk) and ensures the final chunk is created. This systematic approach ensures no content is lost while respecting both structural and size constraints.

### Rich Chunk Creation with Metadata

The final step creates chunks with comprehensive metadata for enhanced retrieval:

```python
    def _create_chunk_from_elements(self, elements: List[DocumentElement],
                                  base_metadata: Dict, section_title: str) -> Document:
        """Create a document chunk with rich metadata."""
        # Combine element content with proper formatting
        content_parts = []
        for element in elements:
            if element.element_type == ContentType.HEADING:
                content_parts.append(f"\n{element.content}\n")
            else:
                content_parts.append(element.content)

        content = "\n".join(content_parts).strip()
```

Content assembly preserves formatting by treating headings specially - they get extra spacing to maintain their visual prominence. This formatting preservation helps both human readers and embedding models understand the content structure.

```python
        # Build enhanced metadata
        content_types = [e.element_type.value for e in elements]
        hierarchy_levels = [e.level for e in elements]

        enhanced_metadata = {
            **base_metadata,
            "section_title": section_title,
            "chunk_type": "hierarchical",
            "content_types": list(set(content_types)),
            "hierarchy_levels": hierarchy_levels,
            "element_count": len(elements),
            "has_heading": ContentType.HEADING.value in content_types,
            "has_table": ContentType.TABLE.value in content_types,
            "has_code": ContentType.CODE.value in content_types,
            "min_hierarchy_level": min(hierarchy_levels),
            "max_hierarchy_level": max(hierarchy_levels)
        }

        return Document(page_content=content, metadata=enhanced_metadata)
```

The metadata enhancement provides multiple search dimensions: content types enable filtering ("find chunks with code"), hierarchy levels support structure-aware retrieval, and boolean flags enable quick filtering. This rich metadata transforms simple text chunks into searchable, contextual knowledge units.

This implementation provides intelligent section grouping, size management, and context preservation through overlap. Notice how we maintain rich metadata throughout the process – this metadata becomes crucial for retrieval quality and debugging.

### Enterprise Chunking Pipeline

For production deployments, you need more than just good chunking – you need quality assessment, optimization feedback loops, and the ability to adjust processing based on document characteristics:

### Enterprise Pipeline - Configuration and Quality Control

```python
class EnterpriseChunkingPipeline:
    """Enterprise-grade chunking pipeline with quality assessment."""
    
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.config = config
        self.chunker = HierarchicalChunker(
            max_chunk_size=config.get("max_chunk_size", 1000),
            overlap_ratio=config.get("overlap_ratio", 0.1)
        )
        self.quality_assessor = ChunkQualityAssessor()
```

The enterprise pipeline uses configuration-driven initialization, enabling different setups for various document types and quality requirements. The quality assessor integration provides automated quality control throughout the processing pipeline.

### Quality-Controlled Document Processing

```python        
    def process_document_with_quality_control(self, document: Document) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Process document with comprehensive quality assessment."""
        # Create initial chunks
        chunks = self.chunker.create_hierarchical_chunks(document)
        
        # Assess chunk quality
        quality_metrics = self.quality_assessor.assess_chunk_quality(chunks)
        
        # Apply quality-based optimization if needed
        if quality_metrics["overall_quality"] < self.config.get("min_quality_threshold", 0.7):
            chunks = self._optimize_chunks(chunks, quality_metrics)
            quality_metrics = self.quality_assessor.assess_chunk_quality(chunks)
```

The quality control loop enables automatic optimization when quality falls below acceptable thresholds. This ensures consistent output quality while providing insight into document processing challenges through the metrics feedback.

### Comprehensive Result Package

```python        
        return {
            "chunks": chunks,
            "quality_metrics": quality_metrics,
            "processing_stats": {
                "original_length": len(document.page_content),
                "chunk_count": len(chunks),
                "avg_chunk_size": sum(len(c.page_content) for c in chunks) / len(chunks),
                "quality_score": quality_metrics["overall_quality"]
            }
        }
```

The return package provides everything needed for downstream processing: optimized chunks, quality insights, and processing statistics. This comprehensive approach supports both automated pipelines and manual quality inspection workflows.

This enterprise pipeline includes quality control and optimization feedback loops. The quality threshold approach ensures you catch and fix problematic chunks before they affect retrieval quality.

## Part 3: Metadata Extraction & Enhancement - Making Content Discoverable

Raw text chunks, no matter how well structured, often lack the context needed for precise retrieval. A chunk about "memory optimization" might be talking about software memory management or human cognitive memory. Metadata extraction solves this by extracting entities, topics, technical terms, and other contextual information that makes content discoverable and meaningful.

### Simple Metadata Extraction

Here's a basic example of extracting useful metadata from document chunks:

```python
import re
from typing import List, Dict

def extract_simple_metadata(text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Extract basic metadata from text content."""
    words = text.split()
    
    # Basic statistics
    metadata = {
        "word_count": len(words),
        "char_count": len(text),
        "sentence_count": len(text.split('.')),
    }
    
    # Extract capitalized words (potential entities)
    capitalized_words = re.findall(r'\b[A-Z][a-z]+\b', text)
    metadata["potential_entities"] = list(set(capitalized_words))[:5]
    
    # Extract numbers and dates
    numbers = re.findall(r'\b\d+(?:\.\d+)?\b', text)
    metadata["numbers"] = [float(n) for n in numbers[:5]]
    
    dates = re.findall(r'\b\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}[/-]\d{4}\b', text)
    metadata["dates"] = dates
    
    # Assess content difficulty
    long_words = [w for w in words if len(w) > 6]
    metadata["difficulty_level"] = "advanced" if len(long_words) / len(words) > 0.3 else "intermediate"
    
    return metadata
```

**Metadata Benefits:**

- **Enhanced searchability**: Additional context for retrieval matching
- **Content understanding**: Insight into chunk characteristics
- **Quality assessment**: Metrics for evaluating chunk usefulness

### Advanced Metadata Extractor - Data Structure & Initialization

The simple approach gives you basic insights, but production systems need more sophisticated extraction that can handle technical content, domain-specific terminology, and complex relationships within text.

First, let's define the data structure for our extracted metadata:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass
class ExtractedMetadata:
    """Container for extracted metadata."""
    entities: List[str]
    keywords: List[str]
    topics: List[str]
    dates: List[str]
    numbers: List[float]
    technical_terms: List[str]
    difficulty_level: str
    content_summary: str
```

The ExtractedMetadata dataclass provides a structured container for all the different types of metadata we'll extract. This structured approach makes the metadata easy to work with and ensures consistent data types across the system.

### Pattern Definitions and Domain Knowledge

Now let's initialize the extractor with domain-specific patterns and knowledge:

```python
class MetadataExtractor:
    """Extracts rich metadata from document content."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.technical_patterns = [
            r'\b[A-Z]{2,}\b',                    # Acronyms
            r'\b\w+\(\)\b',                      # Function calls
            r'\b[a-zA-Z_]\w*\.[a-zA-Z_]\w*\b',   # Object notation
            r'\b\d+\.\d+\.\d+\b',                # Version numbers
        ]

        self.topic_keywords = {
            "technology": ["software", "computer", "digital", "algorithm", "data", "system"],
            "business": ["market", "customer", "revenue", "strategy", "company", "industry"],
            "legal": ["contract", "agreement", "clause", "statute", "regulation", "compliance"],
            "medical": ["patient", "treatment", "diagnosis", "medication", "therapy", "clinical"]
        }
```

The patterns and keywords define domain expertise that enables intelligent content analysis. Technical patterns capture programming constructs and technical terminology, while topic keywords enable automatic domain classification. This knowledge base can be expanded for specific domains or applications.

### Main Extraction Orchestration

The main extraction method coordinates all the different extraction techniques:

```python
    def extract_enhanced_metadata(self, text: str) -> ExtractedMetadata:
        """Extract comprehensive metadata from text."""
        
        # Extract different types of information
        entities = self._extract_entities(text)
        keywords = self._extract_keywords(text)
        topics = self._infer_topics(text)
        dates = self._extract_dates(text)
        numbers = self._extract_numbers(text)
        technical_terms = self._extract_technical_terms(text)
        difficulty_level = self._assess_difficulty(text)
        content_summary = self._generate_summary(text)

        return ExtractedMetadata(
            entities=entities,
            keywords=keywords,
            topics=topics,
            dates=dates,
            numbers=numbers,
            technical_terms=technical_terms,
            difficulty_level=difficulty_level,
            content_summary=content_summary
        )
```

This orchestration method calls specialized extractors for each metadata type. The modular approach allows for easy testing and improvement of individual extraction techniques while maintaining a consistent interface.

### Entity Extraction with Pattern Matching

Entity extraction identifies names, terms, and concepts that are likely to be important:

```python
    def _extract_entities(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
        """Extract named entities using pattern matching."""
        entities = []

        # Extract capitalized words (potential proper nouns)
        capitalized_words = re.findall(r'\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*\b', text)
        entities.extend(capitalized_words)

        # Extract quoted terms
        quoted_terms = re.findall(r'"([^"]*)"', text)
        entities.extend(quoted_terms)

        # Remove duplicates and filter by length
        entities = list(set([e for e in entities if 2 < len(e) < 50]))

        return entities[:10]  # Limit to top 10
```

Entity extraction combines multiple heuristics: capitalized words often represent proper nouns (names, places, technologies), while quoted terms typically indicate important concepts or technical terms. The filtering removes noise (very short or very long matches) and limits results to prevent overwhelming the metadata.

### Topic Inference Through Keyword Analysis

```python
    def _infer_topics(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
        """Infer topics from content using keyword analysis."""
        text_lower = text.lower()
        topic_scores = {}

        for topic, keywords in self.topic_keywords.items():
            score = sum(text_lower.count(keyword) for keyword in keywords)
            if score > 0:
                topic_scores[topic] = score

        # Return topics sorted by relevance
        return sorted(topic_scores.keys(), key=lambda x: topic_scores[x], reverse=True)[:3]
```

Topic inference uses keyword frequency to classify content. Each domain gets a relevance score based on how many domain-specific keywords appear in the text. This enables automatic tagging that helps with retrieval filtering ("show me all technology-related chunks") and content organization.

### Difficulty Assessment Through Multiple Metrics

```python
    def _assess_difficulty(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Assess content difficulty level."""
        words = text.split()
        sentences = text.split('.')

        if not words or not sentences:
            return "unknown"

        # Calculate readability metrics
        avg_words_per_sentence = len(words) / len(sentences)
        long_words = len([w for w in words if len(w) > 6])
        long_word_ratio = long_words / len(words) if words else 0

        # Technical term density
        technical_terms = len(self._extract_technical_terms(text))
        technical_density = technical_terms / len(words) if words else 0

        # Determine difficulty
        if avg_words_per_sentence > 20 or long_word_ratio > 0.3 or technical_density > 0.1:
            return "advanced"
        elif avg_words_per_sentence > 15 or long_word_ratio > 0.2:
            return "intermediate"
        else:
            return "beginner"
```

Difficulty assessment combines multiple readability indicators: sentence length (complex ideas often need longer sentences), vocabulary complexity (longer words typically indicate more advanced concepts), and technical density (specialized terminology suggests expert content). This classification helps users find content appropriate to their level and enables difficulty-based filtering.

### Metadata-Enhanced Chunking Integration

The real power emerges when you combine hierarchical chunking with metadata extraction. This creates chunks that are both structurally coherent and contextually rich – the foundation of high-precision retrieval:

### MetadataEnhancedChunker - Initialization and Core Processing

```python
class MetadataEnhancedChunker:
    """Chunker that enriches chunks with extracted metadata."""

    def __init__(self, max_chunk_size: int = 1000):
        self.hierarchical_chunker = HierarchicalChunker(max_chunk_size=max_chunk_size)
        self.metadata_extractor = MetadataExtractor()
```

The MetadataEnhancedChunker combines hierarchical chunking with metadata extraction, creating a two-stage process that first respects document structure, then enriches each chunk with contextual information.

### Two-Stage Enhancement Process

```python
    def create_enhanced_chunks(self, document: Document) -> List[Document]:
        """Create chunks with rich metadata."""
        # First, create hierarchical chunks
        chunks = self.hierarchical_chunker.create_hierarchical_chunks(document)

        # Enhance each chunk with extracted metadata
        enhanced_chunks = []
        for chunk in chunks:
            enhanced_chunk = self._enhance_chunk_metadata(chunk)
            enhanced_chunks.append(enhanced_chunk)

        return enhanced_chunks
```

This two-stage approach ensures optimal chunking boundaries (via hierarchical chunking) before adding metadata enrichment. The separation of concerns makes the system modular - you can swap chunking strategies or metadata extraction techniques independently.

### Metadata Integration and Enhancement

```python
    def _enhance_chunk_metadata(self, chunk: Document) -> Document:
        """Enhance chunk with extracted metadata."""
        # Extract metadata from chunk content
        extracted_metadata = self.metadata_extractor.extract_enhanced_metadata(chunk.page_content)

        # Merge extracted metadata with existing metadata
        enhanced_metadata = {
            **chunk.metadata,
            "entities": extracted_metadata.entities,
            "keywords": extracted_metadata.keywords,
            "topics": extracted_metadata.topics,
            "technical_terms": extracted_metadata.technical_terms,
            "difficulty_level": extracted_metadata.difficulty_level,
            "content_summary": extracted_metadata.content_summary,
            "enhanced_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
```

Metadata merging preserves existing chunk metadata (section titles, hierarchy levels) while adding extracted information. The timestamp tracks when enhancement occurred, enabling cache invalidation and processing pipeline monitoring.

### Searchable Content Creation

```python
        # Create searchable content that includes metadata
        searchable_content = self._create_searchable_content(chunk.page_content, extracted_metadata)

        return Document(page_content=searchable_content, metadata=enhanced_metadata)

    def _create_searchable_content(self, original_content: str, metadata: ExtractedMetadata) -> str:
        """Create enhanced searchable content."""
        metadata_text_parts = []

        if metadata.keywords:
            metadata_text_parts.append(f"Keywords: {', '.join(metadata.keywords)}")

        if metadata.topics:
            metadata_text_parts.append(f"Topics: {', '.join(metadata.topics)}")

        if metadata.entities:
            metadata_text_parts.append(f"Entities: {', '.join(metadata.entities[:5])}")

        metadata_text = "\n".join(metadata_text_parts)

        # Combine original content with metadata
        if metadata_text:
            return f"{original_content}\n\n--- Metadata ---\n{metadata_text}"
        else:
            return original_content
```

The searchable content enhancement embeds metadata directly into the chunk text, making it discoverable during vector similarity search. This approach enables queries like "find database optimization" to match chunks containing those keywords even if they weren't in the original text but were inferred from context.

---

## Part 4: Multi-Modal & Quality Assessment - Handling the Complex Stuff

Real documents aren't just paragraphs and headings. They contain tables with structured data, code blocks with syntactic relationships, lists with hierarchical information, and images with contextual relevance. Naive chunking destroys these structures. Advanced preprocessing preserves them.

### Table-Aware Processing

Tables are particularly challenging because they encode relationships between data points that are completely lost when split by arbitrary text boundaries. A table about quarterly revenue broken in half becomes meaningless – you need specialized handling:

```python
def process_simple_table(table_text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Process table content while preserving structure."""
    lines = table_text.strip().split('\n')
    table_lines = [line for line in lines if '|' in line]
    
    if not table_lines:
        return {"error": "No table structure found"}
    
    # Extract headers from first row
    header_row = table_lines[0]
    headers = [cell.strip() for cell in header_row.split('|') if cell.strip()]
    
    # Count data rows (excluding header and separator)
    data_rows = len(table_lines) - 2 if len(table_lines) > 2 else 0
    
    # Create enhanced description
    description = f"Table with {data_rows} rows and {len(headers)} columns"
    if headers:
        description += f" containing data about: {', '.join(headers)}"
    
    return {
        "enhanced_content": f"{description}\n\n{table_text}",
        "metadata": {
            "content_type": "table",
            "row_count": data_rows,
            "column_count": len(headers),
            "headers": headers
        }
    }
```

**Table Processing Benefits:**

- **Structure preservation**: Tables remain intact and meaningful
- **Enhanced searchability**: Descriptive text makes tables discoverable
- **Metadata enrichment**: Table characteristics available for retrieval

### Basic Quality Assessment

Quality assessment is essential because not all chunks are created equal. Some preserve meaning well, others lose crucial context. You need metrics to identify and fix problematic chunks before they affect retrieval performance:

```python
def assess_basic_quality(chunks: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Assess basic quality metrics for chunks."""
    if not chunks:
        return {"error": "No chunks to assess"}
    
    # Calculate size consistency
    chunk_sizes = [len(chunk) for chunk in chunks]
    avg_size = sum(chunk_sizes) / len(chunk_sizes)
    size_variance = sum((size - avg_size) ** 2 for size in chunk_sizes) / len(chunk_sizes)
    size_consistency = 1.0 / (1.0 + size_variance / (avg_size ** 2))
    
    # Calculate information density
    densities = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        words = chunk.split()
        unique_words = set(words)
        if words:
            density = len(unique_words) / len(words)
            densities.append(density)
    
    avg_density = sum(densities) / len(densities) if densities else 0
    
    return {
        "size_consistency": size_consistency,
        "avg_information_density": avg_density,
        "chunk_count": len(chunks),
        "avg_chunk_size": avg_size
    }
```

### Complete Processing Pipeline - Initialization & Strategy

Now we bring everything together into a comprehensive processing pipeline that analyzes document characteristics, chooses appropriate strategies, and applies quality controls.

```python
class AdvancedProcessingPipeline:
    """Complete advanced document processing pipeline."""

    def __init__(self, max_chunk_size: int = 1000, enable_quality_assessment: bool = True):
        self.max_chunk_size = max_chunk_size
        self.enable_quality_assessment = enable_quality_assessment
        
        # Initialize processors
        self.metadata_chunker = MetadataEnhancedChunker(max_chunk_size=max_chunk_size)
        self.quality_assessor = ChunkQualityAssessor() if enable_quality_assessment else None
```

The pipeline initialization sets up all the necessary components with configurable parameters. The enable_quality_assessment flag allows you to disable expensive quality checks in time-sensitive scenarios while maintaining the option for thorough analysis when needed.

### Document Processing with Adaptive Strategy Selection

The main processing method orchestrates document analysis, strategy selection, and quality control:

```python
    def process_document(self, document: Document) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Process document using the most appropriate strategy."""
        
        # Analyze document characteristics
        doc_analysis = self._analyze_document_complexity(document)
        
        # Choose processing strategy
        if doc_analysis["has_tables"]:
            print("Detected tables - using table-aware processing...")
            processed_chunks = self._process_with_table_awareness(document)
        else:
            print("Using standard hierarchical processing...")
            processed_chunks = self.metadata_chunker.create_enhanced_chunks(document)
```

Strategy selection based on content analysis ensures optimal processing. Table-aware processing preserves table structure and relationships, while hierarchical processing respects document organization. This adaptive approach handles diverse document types without manual configuration.

### Quality Assessment and Metadata Enhancement

```python
        # Assess quality if enabled
        quality_metrics = {}
        if self.enable_quality_assessment and self.quality_assessor:
            quality_metrics = self.quality_assessor.assess_chunk_quality(processed_chunks)
        
        # Add processing metadata
        for chunk in processed_chunks:
            chunk.metadata.update({
                "processing_strategy": doc_analysis["recommended_strategy"],
                "document_complexity": doc_analysis["complexity_score"],
                "processing_pipeline": "advanced_v2"
            })
```

Quality assessment provides feedback on chunking effectiveness, enabling monitoring and optimization. The metadata enhancement adds processing context to each chunk, supporting debugging, analytics, and processing pipeline versioning.

### Results Assembly with Comprehensive Statistics

```python
        return {
            "chunks": processed_chunks,
            "document_analysis": doc_analysis,
            "quality_metrics": quality_metrics,
            "processing_stats": {
                "chunk_count": len(processed_chunks),
                "total_processed_chars": sum(len(c.page_content) for c in processed_chunks),
                "avg_chunk_size": sum(len(c.page_content) for c in processed_chunks) / len(processed_chunks)
            }
        }
```

The comprehensive return structure provides everything needed for downstream processing: the processed chunks, analysis insights, quality metrics, and processing statistics. This rich output supports both automated pipelines and manual quality inspection.

### Document Complexity Analysis

```python
    def _analyze_document_complexity(self, document: Document) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Analyze document to determine optimal processing strategy."""
        content = document.page_content

        # Detect various content types
        has_tables = "|" in content and content.count("|") > 5
        has_code = "```" in content or content.count("    ") > 3
        has_lists = content.count("- ") > 3 or content.count("* ") > 3
        has_headings = content.count("#") > 2
```

Content type detection uses simple but effective heuristics: pipe characters suggest tables, code blocks indicate technical content, list markers show structured information, and hash symbols reveal hierarchical organization. These patterns guide processing strategy selection.

### Complexity Scoring and Strategy Recommendation

```python
        # Calculate complexity score
        complexity_score = 0
        if has_tables: complexity_score += 3
        if has_code: complexity_score += 2
        if has_lists: complexity_score += 1
        if has_headings: complexity_score += 2

        # Determine strategy
        if has_tables:
            strategy = "table_aware"
        elif complexity_score > 4:
            strategy = "hierarchical"
        else:
            strategy = "standard"

        return {
            "has_tables": has_tables,
            "has_code": has_code,
            "has_lists": has_lists,
            "has_headings": has_headings,
            "complexity_score": complexity_score,
            "recommended_strategy": strategy
        }
```

The scoring system weights different content types by their processing complexity and importance: tables (3 points) require the most sophisticated handling, code blocks (2 points) and headings (2 points) benefit from structure-aware processing, while lists (1 point) add moderate complexity. The strategy recommendation ensures documents get appropriate processing without over-engineering simple content.

### Enterprise Quality Control - Multi-Dimensional Assessment

The final component is comprehensive quality assessment that evaluates chunks across multiple dimensions. This enables automated quality control and optimization feedback.

```python
class ChunkQualityAssessor:
    """Comprehensive chunk quality assessment."""

    def assess_chunk_quality(self, chunks: List[Document]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Multi-dimensional quality assessment."""
        if not chunks:
            return {metric: 0.0 for metric in ["coherence", "density", "consistency", "overall"]}

        # Calculate individual metrics
        coherence = self._calculate_coherence_score(chunks)
        density = self._calculate_information_density(chunks)
        consistency = self._calculate_size_consistency(chunks)
        metadata_richness = self._calculate_metadata_richness(chunks)

        overall_quality = (coherence + density + consistency + metadata_richness) / 4

        return {
            "coherence_score": coherence,
            "information_density": density,
            "size_consistency": consistency,
            "metadata_richness": metadata_richness,
            "overall_quality": overall_quality
        }
```

The main assessment method coordinates four quality dimensions: coherence (topic consistency between adjacent chunks), density (information richness), consistency (size uniformity), and metadata richness (completeness of extracted metadata). The overall quality score provides a single metric for automated quality control decisions.

### Topic Coherence Analysis

```python
    def _calculate_coherence_score(self, chunks: List[Document]) -> float:
        """Calculate topic coherence between adjacent chunks."""
        if len(chunks) < 2:
            return 1.0

        coherence_scores = []
        for i in range(len(chunks) - 1):
            current_topics = set(chunks[i].metadata.get("topics", []))
            next_topics = set(chunks[i + 1].metadata.get("topics", []))
            
            if current_topics and next_topics:
                overlap = len(current_topics & next_topics)
                union = len(current_topics | next_topics)
                score = overlap / union if union > 0 else 0
                coherence_scores.append(score)

        return sum(coherence_scores) / len(coherence_scores) if coherence_scores else 0.0
```

Coherence assessment measures how well adjacent chunks relate to each other thematically. Using Jaccard similarity (intersection over union) on topic sets, we identify cases where chunking boundaries break logical topic flow. High coherence suggests good boundary detection, while low coherence indicates potential over-segmentation.

### Information Density Measurement

```python
    def _calculate_information_density(self, chunks: List[Document]) -> float:
        """Calculate average information density across chunks."""
        densities = []
        
        for chunk in chunks:
            words = chunk.page_content.split()
            unique_words = set(words)
            
            if words:
                density = len(unique_words) / len(words)
                densities.append(density)
        
        return sum(densities) / len(densities) if densities else 0.0
```

Information density measures vocabulary richness within chunks. High density indicates diverse, information-rich content, while low density suggests repetitive or filler text. This metric helps identify chunks that may be too large (combining disparate content) or too small (fragmenting coherent ideas).

### Metadata Completeness Assessment

```python
    def _calculate_metadata_richness(self, chunks: List[Document]) -> float:
        """Assess metadata completeness across chunks."""
        expected_fields = ["topics", "entities", "keywords", "difficulty_level"]
        
        richness_scores = []
        for chunk in chunks:
            present_fields = sum(1 for field in expected_fields 
                               if field in chunk.metadata and chunk.metadata[field])
            score = present_fields / len(expected_fields)
            richness_scores.append(score)
        
        return sum(richness_scores) / len(richness_scores) if richness_scores else 0.0
```

Metadata richness evaluates how well the extraction pipeline populated chunk metadata. Complete metadata enables better retrieval filtering and content understanding. Low richness scores indicate either extraction failures or content that lacks extractable features, both valuable signals for pipeline optimization.
