## üìö Advanced Metrics Content

### Neural Evaluation Metrics

Advanced neural-based evaluation that goes beyond traditional metrics:

```python
# Advanced neural evaluation metrics
class NeuralEvaluationMetrics:
    """Neural-based evaluation metrics for sophisticated RAG assessment."""

    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.bert_scorer = BERTScorer(lang="en", rescale_with_baseline=True)
        self.semantic_similarity_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
        self.perplexity_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
```

This class initializes three key neural evaluation models. The BERTScorer uses contextual embeddings to measure semantic similarity more accurately than traditional metrics like BLEU. The SentenceTransformer creates dense vector representations for semantic comparison, while the GPT-2 model can be used for perplexity-based quality assessment.

```python
    async def calculate_bert_score(self, predictions: List[str],
                                 references: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate BERTScore for semantic similarity evaluation."""
        P, R, F1 = self.bert_scorer.score(predictions, references)

        return {
            'bert_precision': P.mean().item(),
            'bert_recall': R.mean().item(),
            'bert_f1': F1.mean().item()
        }
```

BERTScore provides three metrics: precision (how much of the prediction is relevant), recall (how much of the reference is captured), and F1 (harmonic mean of precision and recall). Unlike BLEU scores, BERTScore captures semantic similarity even when exact word matches don't occur.

```python
    async def evaluate_semantic_coherence(self, response: str,
                                        contexts: List[str]) -> float:
        """Evaluate semantic coherence between response and contexts."""
        response_embedding = self.semantic_similarity_model.encode([response])
        context_embeddings = self.semantic_similarity_model.encode(contexts)

        # Calculate coherence as average similarity
        similarities = cosine_similarity(response_embedding, context_embeddings)[0]
        return float(np.mean(similarities))
```

This method evaluates how well a RAG response aligns semantically with its source contexts. High coherence scores indicate the response accurately reflects the information from retrieved documents, while low scores may signal hallucination or poor context utilization.

### Domain-Specific Evaluation

Specialized evaluation for different domains:

```python
class DomainSpecificEvaluator:
    """Domain-specific evaluation metrics for specialized RAG applications."""

    def __init__(self, domain: str):
        self.domain = domain
        self.domain_evaluators = {
            'medical': MedicalRAGEvaluator(),
            'legal': LegalRAGEvaluator(),
            'financial': FinancialRAGEvaluator(),
            'scientific': ScientificRAGEvaluator()
        }
```

Domain-specific evaluation recognizes that different fields have unique quality requirements. Medical RAG systems need safety checks, legal systems require accuracy in citations, financial systems need compliance verification, and scientific systems must validate methodology and evidence quality.

```python
    async def evaluate_medical_accuracy(self, response: str,
                                      medical_context: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Evaluate medical accuracy with domain-specific checks."""
        evaluator = self.domain_evaluators['medical']

        return {
            'medical_terminology_accuracy': evaluator.check_terminology(response),
            'contraindication_safety': evaluator.check_contraindications(response),
            'evidence_level': evaluator.assess_evidence_quality(response, medical_context),
            'clinical_relevance': evaluator.assess_clinical_relevance(response)
        }
```

Medical RAG evaluation focuses on four critical dimensions: terminology accuracy ensures proper medical language usage, contraindication safety prevents dangerous drug interactions or treatment recommendations, evidence level assesses the quality of supporting research, and clinical relevance measures practical applicability to patient care.

### Explainability Metrics

Metrics for evaluating the explainability of RAG decisions:

```python
class ExplainabilityEvaluator:
    """Evaluate the explainability and interpretability of RAG decisions."""

    def calculate_attribution_scores(self, query: str, response: str,
                                   retrieved_docs: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Calculate how much each retrieved document contributed to the response."""
        attribution_scores = {}
```

Explainability evaluation helps understand which retrieved documents most influenced the final response. This is crucial for building trust in RAG systems, especially in high-stakes domains where users need to understand why specific information was included.

```python
        for i, doc in enumerate(retrieved_docs):
            # Remove this document and see impact on response
            modified_docs = retrieved_docs[:i] + retrieved_docs[i+1:]
            modified_response = self._generate_with_docs(query, modified_docs)

            # Calculate attribution as difference in response quality
            original_quality = self._assess_response_quality(response)
            modified_quality = self._assess_response_quality(modified_response)

            attribution_scores[f'doc_{i}'] = original_quality - modified_quality

        return attribution_scores
```

The attribution calculation uses a leave-one-out approach: by removing each document and measuring the quality impact, we can quantify each document's contribution. Higher attribution scores indicate documents that were more essential to generating a high-quality response, providing transparency into the RAG decision process.
