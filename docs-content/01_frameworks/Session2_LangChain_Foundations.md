# Session 2: LangChain Foundations - Building Intelligent Data Pipeline Architectures

Imagine you're architecting a massive data processing system where intelligent agents orchestrate petabyte-scale analytics - data quality monitors coordinate with pipeline validators, streaming processors adapt to real-time anomalies, and ML pipeline components make autonomous optimization decisions across distributed data infrastructure. This is exactly what LangChain enables for data engineering: a sophisticated framework that transforms isolated model calls into orchestrated, intelligent data systems that can reason about data quality, remember processing patterns, and act purposefully across complex data workflows.

In this session, you'll build your first LangChain applications designed for data engineering scenarios and discover why this framework has become essential for intelligent data infrastructure.

**Code Repository**: [`src/session2/`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/tree/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session2)
**Quick Start**: `cd src/session2 && python langchain_basics.py`

## LangChain Architecture Overview: The Data Processing Orchestrator

Building on the bare metal foundations from Session 1, LangChain operates like a master data pipeline orchestrator managing distributed analytics workloads. Each component - models, prompts, chains, and memory - handles specific data processing responsibilities, but the true power emerges when they're orchestrated together to create intelligent data systems that understand context, optimize automatically, and scale seamlessly across your data infrastructure.

### Core Components

LangChain has four essential building blocks that work together like specialized services in a modern data platform:

![LangChain Overview](images/langchain-overview.svg)

1. **LLMs**: These are your intelligent data analysts that provide insights and generate responses about data patterns, quality issues, and optimization strategies
2. **Tools**: External data processing functions that extend agent capabilities beyond text generation - like giving your AI direct access to data warehouses, streaming platforms, and ML pipelines
3. **Memory**: Context storage for processing continuity - the agent's ability to remember previous data insights, processing decisions, and optimization patterns
4. **Agents**: Orchestration layer that coordinates data workflows - the intelligent dispatcher that decides which data processing actions to take when

### Installation and Setup

First, we'll set up the foundation that transforms individual API calls into sophisticated data processing intelligence:

```bash
pip install langchain==0.1.0 openai==1.0.0
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Essential Imports

These imports provide access to LangChain's core functionality, giving you the building blocks for intelligent data applications:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import Tool, initialize_agent
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler
```

### LLM Initialization

Create an LLM instance with proper configuration - this is where raw computational power becomes accessible data intelligence:

```python
def create_llm(provider="openai"):
    if provider == "openai":
        return ChatOpenAI(
            model="gpt-4",
            temperature=0.7
        )
```

The temperature parameter controls output randomness: 0 for deterministic responses (like precise data validation), 1 for creative responses (like exploring data anomaly explanations).

### Usage with Error Handling

Always include error handling when initializing LLMs - production data systems need graceful failure handling:

```python
try:
    llm = create_llm("openai")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"LLM initialization failed: {e}")
    # Implement fallback logic here
```

### Component Flow

Here's how LangChain components work together in an intelligent data processing workflow:

```text
Data Input → Agent → Tool Selection → LLM Analysis → Output
              ↑              ↓              ↑
           Memory ←→ Context Management ←→ State
```

This flow mirrors how data engineering teams solve complex problems - they ingest data, remember processing context, choose appropriate tools and methods, apply analytical reasoning, and generate actionable insights for downstream systems.

## Chain Patterns: Building Data Processing Pipelines

Chains are where LangChain truly excels for data engineers, transforming simple interactions into sophisticated data processing workflows. Think of chains as data pipelines where each stage adds analytical value and intelligence to your data processing results.

### Simple Chain Creation

Chains combine LLMs with prompt templates for reusable data processing workflows, solving the problem of how to make AI responses consistent and purposeful for data operations:

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

Create a template with variable substitution - this is like creating a data analysis blueprint that adapts to different datasets and scenarios:

```python
template = "Analyze this data quality report and provide optimization recommendations: {data_report}"
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["data_report"])
```

Variables in `{brackets}` enable dynamic content substitution - the same template works for analyzing streaming data quality, batch processing results, or ML model performance metrics.

### Chain Construction and Execution

Build the chain and execute it with data - this is where templates become living, responsive data intelligence systems:

```python
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
result = chain.run("Data pipeline processed 2.3TB with 99.7% success rate, detected 15 schema violations")
print(f"Analysis: {result}")
```

### Sequential Chains

Sequential chains connect multiple analytical steps for complex data workflows, like having multiple data specialists review the same processing results in sequence:

```python
from langchain.chains import SequentialChain
```

Create the first step - data summarization (like having a data analyst extract key insights from processing logs):

```python
summary_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=llm,
    prompt=PromptTemplate(
        template="Summarize key metrics from this data processing report: {data_report}",
        input_variables=["data_report"]
    ),
    output_key="summary"
)
```

Create the second step - anomaly analysis (like having a data reliability engineer interpret patterns and identify issues):

```python
anomaly_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=llm,
    prompt=PromptTemplate(
        template="Identify potential data quality issues and anomalies in: {summary}",
        input_variables=["summary"]
    ),
    output_key="anomalies"
)
```

Each step's output feeds into the next step's input, creating a processing pipeline that mirrors how data teams collaborate on complex analytical workflows.

### Pipeline Assembly and Execution

Combine the chains into a complete data analysis pipeline - this creates a system where the whole provides deeper insights than individual analyses:

```python
analysis_pipeline = SequentialChain(
    chains=[summary_chain, anomaly_chain],
    input_variables=["data_report"],
    output_variables=["summary", "anomalies"]
)
```

Execute the complete pipeline - watch as your raw processing reports transform into structured data insights:

```python
results = analysis_pipeline.run({"data_report": "Detailed data processing logs and metrics..."})
```

### Prompt Templates

Prompt templates create reusable, parameterized prompts with variables, solving the challenge of how to maintain consistency while adapting to different data contexts:

```python
template = """
Role: {role}
Data Analysis Task: {task} 
Dataset Context: {context}
Output Format: {format}
"""
```

Define the template with input variables - this creates a flexible framework for various data analysis scenarios:

```python
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=template,
    input_variables=["role", "task", "context", "format"]
)
```

Variables are filled in at runtime, enabling dynamic prompt generation that adapts to specific data processing needs while maintaining analytical rigor.

### Using Templates with Chains

Combine the template with a chain for dynamic data analysis responses - this is where templates become powerful, adaptive interfaces for data intelligence:

```python
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
result = chain.run(
    role="Data Quality Engineer",
    task="Analyze streaming data anomalies",
    context="Real-time customer behavior data from e-commerce platform",
    format="JSON with severity levels and recommended actions"
)
```

### Error Handling and Retry Logic

Robust error handling is crucial for production data systems, transforming brittle demos into resilient data infrastructure. Common failures include API rate limits, network timeouts, and service unavailability:

```python
from langchain.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler
import time
```

Implement retry logic with exponential backoff - this pattern handles temporary failures gracefully in data processing pipelines:

```python
def run_with_retry(chain, inputs, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return chain.run(inputs)
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Wait: 1s, 2s, 4s
```

### Usage Example

Use the retry function with proper error handling - this ensures your data processing applications maintain uptime and reliability:

```python
try:
    result = run_with_retry(chain, {"data_report": "example processing logs"})
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Data analysis chain failed after retries: {e}")
```

## Agent Creation & Tool Integration: Giving Data AI Hands to Work

Moving beyond text generation, we now give our agents the ability to take action in data systems. This is where AI transforms from passive analyzers to active data infrastructure partners.

### Understanding Tools

Tools extend agent capabilities beyond text generation, like giving a brilliant data scientist the ability to directly interact with your data infrastructure:

- Data Warehouse: SQL queries and analytics across petabyte-scale datasets
- Streaming Platforms: Real-time data processing and monitoring capabilities
- ML Pipeline: Model training, deployment, and performance monitoring
- Data Quality: Schema validation, anomaly detection, and quality scoring

### Tool Creation Methods

There are three ways to create tools in LangChain, each optimized for different data engineering use cases:

```python
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain.tools import tool
```

#### Method 1: Explicit Tool Creation

Define a function and wrap it in a Tool class - this approach gives you maximum control and clarity for data operations:

```python
def query_data_warehouse(sql_query: str) -> str:
    """Execute SQL query against data warehouse"""
    # In reality, connect to Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift
    return f"Query results: {sql_query} returned 1,847 rows with avg processing time 2.3s"
```

Wrap the function in a Tool - this creates a standardized interface that agents can understand and use for data analysis:

```python
warehouse_tool = Tool(
    name="DataWarehouse",
    description="Execute SQL queries against the enterprise data warehouse",
    func=query_data_warehouse
)
```

#### Method 2: Decorator Approach

Use the @tool decorator for cleaner syntax - this is like adding intelligence to standard data processing functions:

```python
@tool
def check_data_quality(dataset_path: str) -> str:
    """Analyze data quality metrics for specified dataset"""
    try:
        # Connect to data quality monitoring system
        quality_score = 94.7  # Would calculate from actual metrics
        return f"Data quality score: {quality_score}%, Schema compliance: 98.2%, Null rate: 1.3%"
    except:
        return "Cannot access data quality metrics for this dataset"
```

**Production Note**: Always use proper data connections and error handling in production environments to prevent data access issues.

#### Method 3: Simple Wrapper

Quick wrapper for testing purposes - perfect for prototyping data processing capabilities:

```python
def monitor_streaming_pipeline(pipeline_id: str) -> str:
    """Monitor real-time data streaming pipeline status"""
    return f"Pipeline {pipeline_id}: Processing 15,000 events/sec, Latency: 150ms, No errors"
```

Create the tool wrapper - this makes any data function available to your intelligent agents:

```python
streaming_tool = Tool(
    name="StreamingMonitor",
    description="Monitor real-time data pipeline performance and status", 
    func=monitor_streaming_pipeline
)
```

### Agent Initialization

Agents follow the **ReAct pattern** (Reasoning + Acting) - a cycle that mirrors how data engineers approach complex data problems:

1. **Think**: Analyze the data request and understand what processing is needed
2. **Act**: Use appropriate data tools to gather information or process data
3. **Think**: Process the results and determine if additional data operations are needed
4. **Act**: Use more data tools if the analysis isn't complete
5. **Think**: Formulate final insights based on all gathered data evidence

### Setting Up Memory

First, configure conversation memory - this gives agents the ability to maintain context across multiple data analysis interactions:

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
```

Memory stores analytical context like a data scientist's working memory during extended data exploration sessions:

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history",
    return_messages=True
)
```

### Creating the Agent

Combine tools, LLM, and memory into an agent - this creates an intelligent data system that can reason about data, remember context, and take action:

```python
tools = [warehouse_tool, check_data_quality, streaming_tool]
```

Initialize the agent with all components - this is where individual pieces become an intelligent, coordinated data processing system:

```python
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent_type=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True  # Show reasoning process
)
```

The agent now has reasoning (LLM), capabilities (data tools), and context (memory) - everything needed for intelligent data analysis and processing.

### Tool Calling in Action

Run the agent with a complex data request that needs multiple tools - watch as it breaks down data problems like an experienced data engineer:

```python
response = agent.run(
    "Check the data quality of our customer behavior dataset and query the warehouse for any recent anomalies"
)
```

### Agent Thought Process

With verbose=True, you can see the agent's reasoning - this reveals the sophisticated data analysis decision-making happening behind the scenes:

```text
Thought: I need to check data quality AND query for anomalies
Action: Check data quality tool with customer behavior dataset
Observation: Data quality score: 94.7%, Schema compliance: 98.2%, Null rate: 1.3%
Thought: Now I need to query the warehouse for recent anomalies
Action: Data warehouse tool with anomaly detection query
Observation: Query results: Found 3 potential anomalies in last 24 hours
Thought: I have both results, time to provide comprehensive analysis
Final Answer: Your customer behavior dataset shows good quality (94.7% score) with minimal null values. However, I found 3 recent anomalies that warrant investigation for data pipeline stability.
```

The agent automatically handles complex data coordination tasks that would require explicit programming in traditional systems:

1. Breaks down complex data requests into manageable analytical subtasks
2. Chooses appropriate data tools for each subtask
3. Executes data operations in logical order for efficiency
4. Combines results into coherent, comprehensive data insights

### Error Recovery

Tools can fail for various reasons in real-world data environments - network issues, service outages, and data access problems are inevitable:

- Database downtime when data warehouses are unavailable
- Invalid queries when SQL syntax has errors
- Network timeouts during large data transfers
- Authentication failures when credentials expire

### Graceful Error Handling

Implement error handling to prevent crashes and maintain data processing reliability:

```python
def safe_agent_run(agent, data_question, backup_message=None):
    """Try to run agent, handle failures gracefully"""
    try:
        return agent.run(data_question)
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"Data processing error occurred: {error}")
        
        if backup_message:
            return backup_message
        else:
            return "Experiencing technical difficulties with data access. Please try again later."
```

### Usage Example

Use the wrapper function with fallback messaging - this ensures users always get helpful responses even during data system issues:

```python
result = safe_agent_run(
    agent,
    "Analyze the performance of our ML feature store",
    backup_message="Cannot access ML metrics currently, but I can help with other data analysis tasks!"
)
```

Instead of crashing, the agent provides helpful error messages and suggests alternatives - the difference between a brittle prototype and a production-ready data intelligence system.

## Memory & State Management: Building Persistent Data Intelligence

Memory transforms stateless interactions into coherent, context-aware data analysis conversations. Just as data engineers maintain working knowledge during complex data investigations, agents need memory systems to provide intelligent, contextual responses about ongoing data analysis workflows.

### Memory Types

LangChain offers three main memory types, each optimized for different data analysis scenarios like different types of analytical context:

- **Buffer Memory**: Stores complete analysis history (like detailed audit logs of data processing decisions)
- **Summary Memory**: Summarizes older conversations (like executive briefings that capture key data insights)
- **Window Memory**: Keeps only recent messages (like short-term focus on immediate data processing context)

### When to Use Each Type

Choose memory types based on your data application's needs and constraints:

- **Buffer**: Complex data investigations requiring exact history - perfect for compliance auditing or detailed data quality analysis
- **Summary**: Long data analysis sessions where context matters but details don't - ideal for ongoing data monitoring or trend analysis
- **Window**: Fixed memory size, focus on recent context - best for real-time data processing systems with resource constraints

### Memory Configuration

Import the memory types that will give your agents different analytical cognitive capabilities:

```python
from langchain.memory import (
    ConversationBufferMemory,
    ConversationSummaryMemory,
    ConversationBufferWindowMemory
)
```

#### Buffer Memory: Remember Everything

Perfect for situations where every data processing detail matters - like a compliance auditor capturing every data transformation decision:

```python
full_memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history",
    return_messages=True
)
```

#### Summary Memory: Intelligent Summarization

Uses the LLM to compress old conversations while preserving important data context - like having a data analyst who keeps you briefed on ongoing data investigations:

```python
smart_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(
    llm=llm,  # Needs LLM to create summaries
    memory_key="chat_history", 
    return_messages=True
)
```

#### Window Memory: Recent Context Only

Maintains focus on the most recent data interactions - like having a conversation where you naturally focus on current data processing challenges:

```python
recent_memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history",
    k=5,  # Last 5 question-answer pairs
    return_messages=True
)
```

### State Persistence

Saving memory allows agents to remember previous data analysis sessions across conversations, creating continuity like data team relationships that build analytical understanding over time.

### Basic Persistence Functions

Implement simple file-based persistence - this transforms temporary data interactions into lasting analytical relationships:

```python
import json

def save_conversation(memory, filename):
    """Save data analysis history to file"""
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        messages = memory.chat_memory.messages
        json.dump([str(msg) for msg in messages], f)
    print(f"Data analysis conversation saved to {filename}")
```

Load previous conversations to maintain continuity across data analysis sessions:

```python
def load_conversation(memory, filename):
    """Load previous data analysis history"""
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            old_messages = json.load(f)
            print(f"Loaded {len(old_messages)} previous data analysis messages")
            # Note: Simplified - full implementation needs message reconstruction
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("No previous data analysis found - starting fresh investigation")
```

### Usage Example

Save and load conversations to create persistent data analysis relationships:

```python
# At end of data analysis session
save_conversation(memory, "customer_data_analysis.json")

# At start of new data session
load_conversation(memory, "customer_data_analysis.json")
```

### Context Management

Context gives agents personality and specialized data knowledge, transforming generic AI into domain-specific data experts:

- **Role**: Data Quality Engineer vs ML Pipeline Specialist - different expertise and analytical approaches
- **Knowledge**: Domain-specific data understanding that shapes analytical responses
- **Style**: Communication preferences that match data team expectations

### Creating Specialized Agents

Define a function to build specialized data agents - this is like hiring different data experts for different analytical challenges:

```python
def create_specialized_agent(role_description, tools_list):
    """Build agent with specific data expertise and knowledge"""
    
    system_prompt = f"""
    You are {role_description}.
    
    Always stay focused on data engineering best practices and analytical rigor.
    Be helpful but maintain expertise in your specialized data domain.
    """
```

Set up memory and create the agent - this builds a consistent data analytical personality that teams can rely on:

```python
    memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
        memory_key="chat_history",
        return_messages=True
    )
    
    return initialize_agent(
        tools=tools_list,
        llm=llm,
        agent_type=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
        memory=memory,
        verbose=True,
        agent_kwargs={"system_message": system_prompt}
    )
```

### Creating Expert Agents

Build different specialized data agents - each with their own expertise and analytical personality:

```python
# Data Quality Specialist
quality_agent = create_specialized_agent(
    "a data quality engineer helping teams ensure data reliability and accuracy",
    [data_validation_tool, schema_checker_tool]
)

# ML Pipeline Expert
ml_agent = create_specialized_agent(
    "an ML infrastructure engineer helping teams deploy and monitor machine learning pipelines",
    [model_monitoring_tool, pipeline_orchestration_tool]
)
```
