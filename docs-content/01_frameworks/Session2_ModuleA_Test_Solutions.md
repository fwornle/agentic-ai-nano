# Session 2 - Module A: Test Solutions

**Question 1:** What components are defined in the `AgentRole` dataclass for agent specialization?  

### Answer: B) Name, description, tools, specialization, and expertise_areas

**Explanation:** The `AgentRole` dataclass includes five key components: name (identifier), description (purpose), tools (specific capabilities), specialization (primary focus area), and expertise_areas (list of knowledge domains). This comprehensive structure enables systematic agent creation and management.

**Question 2:** What is the primary purpose of the `MultiAgentOrchestrator` class?  

### Answer: B) Coordinate complex workflows across multiple specialized agents

**Explanation:** The `MultiAgentOrchestrator` manages multiple specialized agents, coordinating their interactions and ensuring efficient task distribution based on each agent's specialization. It handles complex workflows that require collaboration between different agent types.

**Question 3:** How does the workflow coordination engine track execution progress?  

### Answer: B) Uses workflow_context with phases, intermediate_results, and agent_interactions

**Explanation:** The workflow coordination engine maintains a comprehensive `workflow_context` dictionary that tracks phases completed, intermediate results from each phase, and all agent interactions. This enables detailed monitoring and debugging of complex workflows.

**Question 4:** What differentiates a research agent from an analysis agent in the multi-agent system?  

### Answer: B) Specialized tools and system messages focused on their domain

**Explanation:** Research agents get tools for web search, document analysis, and fact-checking, while analysis agents receive data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization tools. Each also has tailored system messages that define their specific roles and approaches.

**Question 5:** What happens in the synthesis phase of the complex workflow?  

### Answer: C) Combines research and analysis results into comprehensive output

**Explanation:** The synthesis phase is the final step that takes results from both the research phase and analysis phase, combining them into a comprehensive output. It leverages accumulated knowledge to create actionable recommendations and structured reports.
