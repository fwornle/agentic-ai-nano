# Session 9: Multi-Agent Patterns & Coordination - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

**Question 1:** What does "ReAct" stand for in the ReAct pattern?  

A) Read and Act  
B) Retrieve and Act  
C) Reflect and Act  
D) Reasoning and Acting ‚úÖ  

**Explanation:** ReAct stands for Reasoning and Acting, representing the iterative cycle of thinking about what to do and then taking action.

**Question 2:** What is the primary benefit of the ReAct pattern over direct prompting?  

A) Faster execution  
B) Simpler implementation  
C) Transparent reasoning with step-by-step thought processes ‚úÖ  
D) Lower cost  

**Explanation:** ReAct provides transparency by showing the agent's reasoning process step-by-step, making it easier to understand and debug agent behavior.

**Question 3:** In multi-agent systems, what is the purpose of a Communication Hub?  

A) Execute agent logic  
B) Manage user interface  
C) Store data  
D) Coordinate message passing between agents ‚úÖ  

**Explanation:** The Communication Hub manages message routing and coordination between agents, enabling structured multi-agent communication.

**Question 4:** What determines when the ReAct reasoning loop terminates?  

A) User intervention  
B) Fixed number of steps  
C) When final_answer action is reached or max steps exceeded ‚úÖ  
D) Random timing  

**Explanation:** The ReAct loop terminates when the agent reaches a final_answer action or when the maximum number of reasoning steps is exceeded.

**Question 5:** How do agents typically reach consensus in multi-agent systems?  

A) Random selection  
B) Voting mechanisms and consensus algorithms ‚úÖ  
C) Manager override  
D) First agent decides  

**Explanation:** Multi-agent consensus is achieved through structured voting mechanisms and consensus algorithms that aggregate agent opinions.

**Question 6:** What is the main advantage of hierarchical coordination patterns?  

A) Faster execution  
B) Lower resource usage  
C) Simpler implementation  
D) Clear command structure with specialized delegation ‚úÖ  

**Explanation:** Hierarchical patterns provide clear command structures with specialized agents handling specific tasks under coordinator oversight.

**Question 7:** In auction-based coordination, how are tasks typically allocated?  

A) Random assignment  
B) Manager assignment  
C) Based on agent capabilities and bid evaluation ‚úÖ  
D) First-come first-served  

**Explanation:** Auction-based coordination allocates tasks by evaluating agent capabilities and bids, ensuring optimal task-agent matching.

**Question 8:** What is the purpose of Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning?  

A) Simple task execution  
B) Error handling  
C) Breaking complex tasks into manageable hierarchies ‚úÖ  
D) Agent communication  

**Explanation:** HTN planning decomposes complex tasks into hierarchical subtasks, making them more manageable and executable by specialized agents.

**Question 9:** How does dynamic replanning differ from static planning?  

A) Uses different algorithms  
B) Plans are created faster  
C) No difference  
D) Adapts plans during execution based on changing conditions ‚úÖ  

**Explanation:** Dynamic replanning continuously adapts the plan during execution based on changing conditions and feedback, unlike static planning.

**Question 10:** What is the main benefit of reflection patterns in multi-agent systems?  

A) Continuous learning and improvement from experience ‚úÖ  
B) Simpler deployment  
C) Faster execution  
D) Lower costs  

**Explanation:** Reflection patterns enable agents to learn from their experiences and continuously improve their performance over time.
