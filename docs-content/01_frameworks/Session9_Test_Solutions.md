# Session 9: Multi-Agent Patterns & Coordination - Test Solutions

## 📝 Multiple Choice Test

### Question 1
### What does "ReAct" stand for in the ReAct pattern?

A) Read and Act  
B) Retrieve and Act  
C) Reflect and Act  
D) Reasoning and Acting ✅  
### Correct Answer: D) Reasoning and Acting

**Explanation:** ReAct stands for Reasoning and Acting, representing the iterative cycle of thinking about what to do and then taking action.

### Question 2
### What is the primary benefit of the ReAct pattern over direct prompting?

A) Faster execution  
B) Simpler implementation  
C) Transparent reasoning with step-by-step thought processes ✅  
D) Lower cost  
### Correct Answer: C) Transparent reasoning with step-by-step thought processes

**Explanation:** ReAct provides transparency by showing the agent's reasoning process step-by-step, making it easier to understand and debug agent behavior.

### Question 3
### In multi-agent systems, what is the purpose of a Communication Hub?

A) Execute agent logic  
B) Manage user interface  
C) Store data  
D) Coordinate message passing between agents ✅  
### Correct Answer: D) Coordinate message passing between agents

**Explanation:** The Communication Hub manages message routing and coordination between agents, enabling structured multi-agent communication.

### Question 4
### What determines when the ReAct reasoning loop terminates?

A) User intervention  
B) Fixed number of steps  
C) When final_answer action is reached or max steps exceeded ✅  
D) Random timing  
### Correct Answer: C) When final_answer action is reached or max steps exceeded

**Explanation:** The ReAct loop terminates when the agent reaches a final_answer action or when the maximum number of reasoning steps is exceeded.

### Question 5
### How do agents typically reach consensus in multi-agent systems?

A) Random selection  
B) Voting mechanisms and consensus algorithms ✅  
C) Manager override  
D) First agent decides  
### Correct Answer: B) Voting mechanisms and consensus algorithms

**Explanation:** Multi-agent consensus is achieved through structured voting mechanisms and consensus algorithms that aggregate agent opinions.

### Question 6
### What is the main advantage of hierarchical coordination patterns?

A) Faster execution  
B) Lower resource usage  
C) Simpler implementation  
D) Clear command structure with specialized delegation ✅  
### Correct Answer: D) Clear command structure with specialized delegation

**Explanation:** Hierarchical patterns provide clear command structures with specialized agents handling specific tasks under coordinator oversight.

### Question 7
### In auction-based coordination, how are tasks typically allocated?

A) Random assignment  
B) Manager assignment  
C) Based on agent capabilities and bid evaluation ✅  
D) First-come first-served  
### Correct Answer: C) Based on agent capabilities and bid evaluation

**Explanation:** Auction-based coordination allocates tasks by evaluating agent capabilities and bids, ensuring optimal task-agent matching.

### Question 8
### What is the purpose of Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning?

A) Simple task execution  
B) Error handling  
C) Breaking complex tasks into manageable hierarchies ✅  
D) Agent communication  
### Correct Answer: C) Breaking complex tasks into manageable hierarchies

**Explanation:** HTN planning decomposes complex tasks into hierarchical subtasks, making them more manageable and executable by specialized agents.

### Question 9
### How does dynamic replanning differ from static planning?

A) Uses different algorithms  
B) Plans are created faster  
C) No difference  
D) Adapts plans during execution based on changing conditions ✅  
### Correct Answer: D) Adapts plans during execution based on changing conditions

**Explanation:** Dynamic replanning continuously adapts the plan during execution based on changing conditions and feedback, unlike static planning.

### Question 10
### What is the main benefit of reflection patterns in multi-agent systems?

A) Continuous learning and improvement from experience ✅  
B) Simpler deployment  
C) Faster execution  
D) Lower costs  
### Correct Answer: A) Continuous learning and improvement from experience

**Explanation:** Reflection patterns enable agents to learn from their experiences and continuously improve their performance over time.
