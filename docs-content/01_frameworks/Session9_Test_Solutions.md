# Session 9: Multi-Agent Patterns & Coordination - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

### Question 1
**What does "ReAct" stand for in the ReAct pattern?**

A) Read and Act  
B) Reasoning and Acting ‚úÖ  
C) Reflect and Act  
D) Retrieve and Act  

**Explanation:** ReAct stands for Reasoning and Acting, representing the iterative cycle of thinking about what to do and then taking action.

### Question 2
**What is the primary benefit of the ReAct pattern over direct prompting?**

A) Faster execution  
B) Transparent reasoning with step-by-step thought processes ‚úÖ  
C) Lower cost  
D) Simpler implementation  

**Explanation:** ReAct provides transparency by showing the agent's reasoning process step-by-step, making it easier to understand and debug agent behavior.

### Question 3
**In multi-agent systems, what is the purpose of a Communication Hub?**

A) Store data  
B) Coordinate message passing between agents ‚úÖ  
C) Execute agent logic  
D) Manage user interface  

**Explanation:** The Communication Hub manages message routing and coordination between agents, enabling structured multi-agent communication.

### Question 4
**What determines when the ReAct reasoning loop terminates?**

A) Fixed number of steps  
B) When final_answer action is reached or max steps exceeded ‚úÖ  
C) User intervention  
D) Random timing  

**Explanation:** The ReAct loop terminates when the agent reaches a final_answer action or when the maximum number of reasoning steps is exceeded.

### Question 5
**How do agents typically reach consensus in multi-agent systems?**

A) First agent decides  
B) Voting mechanisms and consensus algorithms ‚úÖ  
C) Random selection  
D) Manager override  

**Explanation:** Multi-agent consensus is achieved through structured voting mechanisms and consensus algorithms that aggregate agent opinions.

### Question 6
**What is the main advantage of hierarchical coordination patterns?**

A) Faster execution  
B) Clear command structure with specialized delegation ‚úÖ  
C) Lower resource usage  
D) Simpler implementation  

**Explanation:** Hierarchical patterns provide clear command structures with specialized agents handling specific tasks under coordinator oversight.

### Question 7
**In auction-based coordination, how are tasks typically allocated?**

A) Random assignment  
B) Based on agent capabilities and bid evaluation ‚úÖ  
C) First-come first-served  
D) Manager assignment  

**Explanation:** Auction-based coordination allocates tasks by evaluating agent capabilities and bids, ensuring optimal task-agent matching.

### Question 8
**What is the purpose of Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning?**

A) Simple task execution  
B) Breaking complex tasks into manageable hierarchies ‚úÖ  
C) Agent communication  
D) Error handling  

**Explanation:** HTN planning decomposes complex tasks into hierarchical subtasks, making them more manageable and executable by specialized agents.

### Question 9
**How does dynamic replanning differ from static planning?**

A) No difference  
B) Adapts plans during execution based on changing conditions ‚úÖ  
C) Plans are created faster  
D) Uses different algorithms  

**Explanation:** Dynamic replanning continuously adapts the plan during execution based on changing conditions and feedback, unlike static planning.

### Question 10
**What is the main benefit of reflection patterns in multi-agent systems?**

A) Faster execution  
B) Continuous learning and improvement from experience ‚úÖ  
C) Lower costs  
D) Simpler deployment  

**Explanation:** Reflection patterns enable agents to learn from their experiences and continuously improve their performance over time.
