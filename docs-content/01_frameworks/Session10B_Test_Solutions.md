# Session 10 Module B: Enterprise Operations & Scaling - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test Solutions

**Question 1:** Predictive vs Reactive Scaling  

**Explanation**: Predictive scaling uses machine learning and historical patterns to anticipate resource needs before they become critical. This proactive approach prevents performance degradation and ensures optimal user experience by scaling resources in advance of demand spikes, rather than reacting after performance issues have already occurred.

**Question 2:** Error Budget Management Components  

**Explanation**: Effective error budget management in Site Reliability Engineering requires three core components: Service Level Objectives (SLOs) that define reliability targets, error budgets that quantify acceptable failure rates, and burn rate monitoring that tracks how quickly the error budget is being consumed. This combination enables proactive reliability management.

**Question 3:** SEV1 Incident Response  

**Explanation**: SEV1 incidents represent critical service outages requiring immediate response. The protocol includes activating an incident commander, establishing a war room for coordination, engaging on-call engineers, and beginning customer communications within 15 minutes. This rapid response minimizes customer impact and ensures systematic resolution.

**Question 4:** Predictive Scaling Model Factors  

**Explanation**: Effective predictive scaling models analyze multiple temporal dimensions including long-term historical trends, daily usage patterns (peak hours), and weekly patterns (business cycles). This multi-factor approach provides accurate forecasts by capturing various usage cycles and enabling precise resource planning.

**Question 5:** Chaos Engineering Purpose  

**Explanation**: Chaos engineering involves deliberately introducing controlled failures to test system resilience and identify weaknesses before they cause unplanned outages. These experiments validate that circuit breakers, failover mechanisms, and redundancy systems work as designed, improving overall system reliability.

**Question 6:** Performance Bottleneck Prioritization  

**Explanation**: Performance bottlenecks should be prioritized based on their severity level and direct impact on user experience. High-severity issues affecting critical user flows take precedence over lower-impact problems. This approach ensures resources are allocated to maximize system reliability and user satisfaction.

**Question 7:** SRE Dashboard Benefits  

**Explanation**: Comprehensive SRE dashboards provide real-time visibility into service health, SLO compliance, error budget consumption, and incident metrics. This visibility enables proactive decision-making, early problem detection, and informed trade-offs between feature velocity and reliability.
