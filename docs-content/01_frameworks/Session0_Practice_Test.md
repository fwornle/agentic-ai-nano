B) Planning  
C) Tool Use  
D) Reflection  

**Question 2:** The ReAct pattern combines which two key capabilities?  
A) Reflecting and Acting  
B) Reading and Acting  
C) Retrieving and Acting  
D) Reasoning and Acting  

**Question 3:** Which framework is best suited for high-performance applications with minimal resource usage?  
A) PydanticAI  
B) LangChain  
C) Agno  
D) CrewAI  

**Question 4:** What is the primary advantage of the Multi-Agent pattern?  
A) Lower resource usage  
B) Reduced complexity  
C) Specialized expertise collaboration  
D) Faster execution  

**Question 5:** Which framework emphasizes type safety through schema validation?  
A) PydanticAI  
B) CrewAI  
C) LangChain  
D) Agno  

## Test Solutions

**Answer 1:** D) Reflection  
The Reflection pattern specifically involves agents evaluating and improving their own outputs through self-critique and revision cycles.

**Answer 2:** D) Reasoning and Acting  
ReAct combines reasoning (thinking through problems step-by-step) with acting (using tools and taking actions based on that reasoning).

**Answer 3:** A) PydanticAI  
PydanticAI is designed for high-performance applications with type safety and minimal resource overhead, making it ideal for production systems.

**Answer 4:** C) Specialized expertise collaboration  
The Multi-Agent pattern's primary advantage is enabling specialized agents to collaborate, each bringing domain expertise to complex problems.

**Answer 5:** A) PydanticAI  
PydanticAI emphasizes type safety through schema validation, similar to how Pydantic provides type validation for Python applications.
