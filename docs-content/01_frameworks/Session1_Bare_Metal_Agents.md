# Session 1: Bare Metal Agents - The Foundation of All AI Intelligence

Picture this: You're working at a Fortune 500 company where every AI framework feels like a black box. When production systems fail, you can't see inside to debug them. When clients demand custom integrations with legacy mainframes, frameworks don't fit. When security auditors ask "How does this actually work?", you have no clear answer. This is the reality that drives the smartest teams to master bare metal agent implementation first.

Today, we're going back to fundamentals - building AI agents from pure Python and raw LLM APIs. By the end of this session, you'll possess the deep architectural knowledge that separates true AI engineers from framework users.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- **Implement** the core agent architecture patterns using only Python and LLM APIs
- **Build** functional agents that demonstrate all five agentic patterns (Reflection, Tool Use, ReAct, Planning, Multi-Agent)
- **Understand** the separation between model layer (LLM) and application layer (Python logic)
- **Create** agents that integrate with existing enterprise APIs and legacy systems
- **Debug** and customize agent behavior with complete transparency and control

## The Bare Metal Advantage: Why Building from Scratch Changes Everything

### Industry Context & Market Significance

While frameworks dominate headlines, enterprise teams increasingly need bare metal implementations for production control. IBM experts note that "most organizations aren't agent-ready" and require custom solutions that integrate with legacy APIs.

Think of bare metal agents as the difference between driving an automatic car and understanding how the engine actually works. When the automatic transmission breaks down on a deserted highway, you need someone who knows what's happening under the hood.

### What You'll Learn & Why It Matters

You'll master the core architecture patterns that power every agent framework, implement the five fundamental agentic patterns in pure Python, and understand the separation between model layers and application logic. This knowledge transforms you from a framework user into an AI systems architect - someone who can debug any framework issue, build custom enterprise solutions, and make informed architectural decisions for production systems.

### How Bare Metal Agents Stand Out

Unlike frameworks that abstract implementation details, bare metal agents offer complete transparency and control. You'll see exactly how "model layer (LLM) → understand natural language and route intent" while "application layer (Python code) → execute tools, manage flow, send responses." 

This separation is like understanding the division between hardware and software in computer architecture - it allows swapping tools, prompts, or models easily without framework constraints.

### Real-World Applications

Companies use bare metal agents for enterprise API integration, legacy system connectivity, and custom security implementations. Financial firms build trading agents that integrate directly with proprietary systems. Healthcare companies create HIPAA-compliant agents with custom audit trails. Manufacturing companies build agents that communicate with decades-old machinery.

You'll build agents that can integrate with any existing infrastructure while maintaining full control over data flow and processing logic.

## Core Implementation: Building Intelligence from First Principles

### Part 1: Agent Architecture Fundamentals

#### Basic Agent Structure

Every agent needs these core components, just like every living organism needs basic life support systems:

![Agent Pattern Control](images/agent-core-components.png)

**File**: [`src/session1/base_agent.py`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/blob/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session1/base_agent.py)

This is the foundation class for all agents - think of it as the DNA that defines what capabilities every agent should have. The memory list stores past interactions like a human's working memory, while the tools dictionary holds functions the agent can call like a craftsman's toolbox.

### Agent Architecture Foundation - BaseAgent Class

The BaseAgent class serves as the architectural blueprint for all agent implementations, solving the fundamental challenge of how to make software behave intelligently. This design follows the separation of concerns principle, where each component has a specific responsibility - just like how your brain separates memory storage from decision-making from motor control:

```python
class BaseAgent:
    """Foundation class for all agent implementations"""
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4"):
        self.model_name = model_name      # LLM endpoint
        self.memory = []                  # Conversation context
        self.tools = {}                   # Available functions
```

**Memory System Design**: The memory list acts as a sliding window of recent interactions, enabling context-aware responses just like how humans maintain working memory during conversations. In production systems, this would implement sophisticated memory management with compression and relevance scoring to handle thousands of interactions efficiently.

**Tool Registry Pattern**: The tools dictionary uses a registry pattern, allowing dynamic addition and removal of capabilities without modifying core agent logic. Each tool follows a standard interface contract - this is how agents can learn new skills at runtime without recompilation.

### Agent Execution Loop - The Heart of Agency

This is where raw computational power becomes intelligent behavior - the four-step cycle that transforms input into meaningful action:

```python
    def run(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        """Main execution cycle: Input → Reasoning → Action → Response"""
        processed_input = self.process_input(user_input)
        action_plan = self.decide_action(processed_input)
        result = self.execute_action(action_plan)
        return self.format_response(result)
```

**Execution Flow Explanation**: This four-step process mirrors human decision-making - understand the request, plan the response, take action, and communicate results. It's the same pattern whether you're ordering coffee or solving complex engineering problems. Each step can be enhanced with logging, error handling, and performance monitoring for production deployments.

### Key Concepts

Understanding these concepts is like understanding the fundamental forces in physics - they govern everything that follows:

1. **Model Interface**: How agents talk to LLMs  
2. **Memory Management**: Keeping track of context  
3. **Tool Registry**: Available actions the agent can take

#### Input/Output Handling

### Input Processing Pipeline - Structured Data Transformation

Production agents require consistent data structures for reliable processing, just like how airports need standardized protocols to handle flights from different airlines safely:

```python
def process_input(self, user_input: str) -> dict:
    """Transform user input into structured agent format"""
    return {
        "message": user_input,
        "timestamp": datetime.now(),
        "session_id": self.session_id
    }
```

**Structured Input Benefits**: Converting strings to dictionaries enables metadata tracking, audit logging, and complex routing logic. It's like transforming raw voice into structured medical records - the same information becomes much more useful for systematic processing. Production systems expand this with user authentication, request validation, and security scanning.

### Response Formatting System - Consistent Output Interface

This method ensures every agent response follows the same format, creating predictable interfaces that other systems can reliably process:

```python
def format_output(self, agent_response: str) -> str:
    """Standard response formatting for user display"""
    return f"Agent: {agent_response}"
```

**Enterprise Output Considerations**: In production, response formatting handles multiple output channels (web, API, mobile), adds response metadata, implements content filtering, and formats structured data for downstream systems. Think of it as the agent's "public speaking" training - the same intelligence can be presented appropriately for different audiences.

#### State Management

### State Management Architecture - Agent Memory System

The AgentState class implements a comprehensive memory system that enables contextual decision-making across conversation turns. This solves the challenge of how software can maintain coherent behavior over extended interactions:

```python
class AgentState:
    """Comprehensive agent state management system"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_task = None          # Active task context
        self.conversation_history = []    # Interaction timeline
        self.available_tools = []         # Dynamic tool registry
        self.confidence_level = 0.0       # Decision confidence
```

**State Design Patterns**: This structure follows the State pattern from software engineering, enabling different memory strategies (short-term, long-term, episodic) without changing core agent logic. It's like how humans can switch between focused attention and broader contextual awareness seamlessly.

### Dynamic State Updates - Learning from Actions

This is how agents build understanding over time - each interaction becomes part of the agent's growing knowledge about the current situation:

```python
    def update_state(self, action: str, result: str):
        """Track actions and results for context building"""
        self.conversation_history.append({
            "action": action, "result": result,
            "timestamp": datetime.now()
        })
```

**Production State Considerations**: Enterprise systems extend this with state persistence, distributed memory, conflict resolution, and state compression for long-running conversations. It's the difference between remembering a single conversation and maintaining institutional knowledge across thousands of interactions.

### Part 2: Building Your First Agent

#### Simple Agent Implementation

Now we move from theory to practice - building an agent that actually works and demonstrates these principles in action.

### Building Your First Production-Ready Agent

**File Reference**: [`src/session1/base_agent.py`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/blob/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session1/base_agent.py) - Complete SimpleAgent implementation

### Agent Initialization - Memory Foundation

The SimpleAgent demonstrates minimal viable architecture for production systems. Think of this as building the smallest possible house that still has all essential utilities - you can live in it while planning your mansion:

```python
class SimpleAgent:
    """Minimal viable agent with memory persistence"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = []  # Conversation state storage
```

**Architecture Decision**: This minimal design enables rapid prototyping while maintaining production upgrade paths. Every complex system started as a simple working version. Enterprise versions would add configuration management, logging, and health checks at initialization.

### Core Reasoning Engine

This is where the magic happens - connecting human language to AI intelligence through code that transforms requests into responses:

```python
import openai

class SimpleAgent:
    """Basic agent with LLM integration"""
    
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
        self.memory = []
    
    def think(self, input_text: str) -> str:
        """Generate response using LLM"""
        # Build conversation context
        messages = [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant"},
            *self.memory,  # Include conversation history
            {"role": "user", "content": input_text}
        ]
        
        # LLM API call
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=messages,
            temperature=0.7
        )
        
        # Extract and store the response
        ai_response = response.choices[0].message.content
        
        # Update memory for context
        self.memory.append({"role": "user", "content": input_text})
        self.memory.append({"role": "assistant", "content": ai_response})
        
        return ai_response
```

**Memory Management Strategy**: Each interaction updates the conversation history, enabling context-aware responses in multi-turn conversations. This is like how therapists maintain session notes - each interaction builds on previous understanding. Enterprise implementations would add memory compression, relevance scoring, and persistence layers.

### Agent Execution Interface - Public API Design

The run method provides a clean public interface that abstracts internal complexity from users, solving the fundamental challenge of making complex systems simple to use:

```python
    def run(self, input_text: str) -> str:
        """Public interface for agent interaction"""
        return self.think(input_text)
```

**Interface Design Pattern**: This method acts as a facade, hiding implementation details while providing a stable API. It's like how car controls (steering wheel, pedals) stay consistent even as engines become more complex. Production systems would add input validation, error handling, rate limiting, and response caching at this layer.

### Agent Testing and Validation

Testing ensures our agent works correctly before deploying it in real situations where failures have consequences:

```python

# Production-ready testing pattern

agent = SimpleAgent()
response = agent.run("What is machine learning?")
print(f"Agent Response: {response}")
```

**Testing Strategy**: This demonstrates basic functional testing - ensuring the agent can receive input and produce reasonable output. Enterprise testing would include unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and automated regression testing for different input types and edge cases.

#### Basic Reasoning Loop

Now we'll implement the core agent thinking process - the cycle that turns reactive responses into proactive problem-solving.

### Advanced Reasoning Engine - ReAct Pattern Implementation

**File Reference**: [`src/session1/react_agent.py`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/blob/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session1/react_agent.py) - Complete ReAct implementation

The ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern forms the backbone of modern agent systems, implementing an iterative cycle of thought, action, and observation that mirrors human problem-solving. This is how agents move beyond simple question-answering to actually solving complex, multi-step problems.

### ReAct Loop Initialization - Bounded Reasoning Control

This method implements controlled reasoning that prevents the common problem of agents getting stuck in infinite loops:

```python
def reasoning_loop(self, task: str) -> str:
    """Production ReAct implementation with safety bounds"""
    max_steps = 5  # Prevent infinite loops
    
    for step in range(max_steps):
        # Generate contextual reasoning
        thought = self.generate_thought(task, step)
        print(f"Step {step + 1} - Thought: {thought}")
```

**Bounded Reasoning Strategy**: The max_steps parameter prevents infinite loops in production, a critical safety feature. It's like having circuit breakers in electrical systems - they prevent cascading failures. Enterprise systems would implement dynamic step limits based on task complexity, user permissions, and resource constraints.

### Decision Logic and Termination Control

This is where agents learn to recognize when they've solved a problem versus when they need to keep working:

```python
        # Intelligent termination check
        if self.is_task_complete(thought):
            return self.generate_final_answer(thought)
            
        # Action planning and execution
        action = self.decide_action(thought)
        print(f"Step {step + 1} - Action: {action}")
```

**Termination Strategy**: The completion check prevents unnecessary processing while ensuring task resolution. It's the difference between a novice who keeps working even after solving the problem and an expert who recognizes completion. Production systems would implement sophisticated completion detection using confidence scoring, goal achievement metrics, and resource optimization.

Finally, the agent observes the results and updates its memory for the next iteration - creating a learning loop that improves performance over time:

```python
        # Observe: See results
        observation = self.execute_action(action)
        print(f"Step {step + 1} - Observation: {observation}")
        
        # Update state for next iteration
        self.update_memory(thought, action, observation)
    
    return "Task completed after maximum steps"
```

#### Error Handling Patterns

Real-world agents must handle failures gracefully - the difference between research demos and production systems.

This wrapper method ensures agents handle errors gracefully, preventing crashes and providing user-friendly error messages when something goes wrong:

```python
def safe_agent_execution(self, user_input: str) -> str:
    """Execute agent with proper error handling"""
    try:
        return self.run(user_input)
    except Exception as e:
        error_msg = f"Agent encountered an error: {e}"
        self.memory.append(f"Error: {error_msg}")
        return "I apologize, but I encountered an issue. Could you try rephrasing your request?"
```

#### Testing Your Agent

**File**: [`src/session1/test_agents.py`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/blob/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session1/test_agents.py) - Complete test suite

Testing validates that your agent behaves correctly across different scenarios - essential for building confidence before deployment:

```python
def test_simple_agent():
    """Test basic agent functionality"""
    agent = SimpleAgent()
    
    # Test question handling
    response = agent.run("What is AI?")
    assert "asking" in response.lower()
    
    # Test statement handling  
    response = agent.run("I like programming")
    assert "acknowledge" in response.lower()
    
    # Test memory
    assert len(agent.memory) == 4  # 2 user inputs + 2 agent responses
    
    print("✅ All tests passed!")

# Run the test

test_simple_agent()
```

---

### Part 2.5: Understanding the Abstraction Pattern

#### The Production Reality

Imagine you've built your first agent with OpenAI's API hardcoded inside. Everything works great... until your startup grows and you need to:

- **Test without burning cash**: Your CI/CD pipeline can't call GPT-4 on every commit
- **Support multiple models**: Marketing wants Claude for creative tasks, engineering prefers GPT for code
- **Handle regional requirements**: European users need EU-hosted models for compliance
- **Scale costs intelligently**: Development can use cheaper models, production gets the premium ones

Suddenly, your hardcoded `openai.OpenAI()` calls become a liability. You need abstraction.

This scenario plays out at every growing tech company - what works for prototypes breaks at scale.

#### The Abstraction Solution

The solution is to treat your LLM like any other external service - database, payment processor, email provider. You create an interface that defines *what* the service does, then implement *how* different providers do it:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class LLMClient(ABC):
    """Abstract interface - defines WHAT an LLM service should do"""
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def chat(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        """Generate response from LLM - every provider must implement this"""
        pass
```

Now you can create specific implementations for each provider. Notice how they all follow the same interface but handle the provider-specific details internally:

```python
class OpenAIClient(LLMClient):
    """OpenAI implementation - handles OpenAI's specific API format"""
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
    
    async def chat(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        # OpenAI uses "messages" format with roles
        response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content

class AnthropicClient(LLMClient):
    """Anthropic implementation - completely different API, same interface"""
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=api_key)
    
    async def chat(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        # Anthropic uses different API structure, but we hide that complexity
        response = await self.client.messages.create(
            model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        return response.content[0].text
```

#### Dependency Injection in Action

Now your agent doesn't know or care which LLM it's using. It just knows "I have something that can generate text from prompts" - this flexibility is transformative for production systems:

```python
class FlexibleAgent:
    """Agent that works with ANY LLM provider"""
    
    def __init__(self, llm_client: LLMClient):
        self.llm = llm_client  # "Give me any LLM, I'll make it work"
        self.memory = []
    
    async def process(self, input_text: str) -> str:
        # Agent logic stays the same regardless of LLM provider
        response = await self.llm.chat(input_text)
        return response

# Same agent code, different providers:
marketing_agent = FlexibleAgent(AnthropicClient(api_key="..."))  # Claude for creativity
dev_agent = FlexibleAgent(OpenAIClient(api_key="..."))          # GPT for coding
test_agent = FlexibleAgent(MockLLMClient())                     # Mock for testing
```

The power is in the flexibility - you write your agent logic once, and it works with any LLM provider. This is how professional software scales.

#### The Testing Story

Here's where abstraction really pays off. You can create a mock LLM that gives predictable responses without any API calls:

```python
class MockLLMClient(LLMClient):
    """Test double - no real LLM calls, predictable responses"""
    
    async def chat(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        # Smart responses based on prompt content
        if "calculate" in prompt.lower():
            return "I'll help you calculate that. The result is 42."
        elif "error" in prompt.lower():
            raise Exception("Simulated error for testing")
        else:
            return "Mock response for testing purposes"
```

**When you'd use each approach:**

**Mocks for Speed & Control:**

- **Unit testing**: Test your agent logic without LLM costs or latency
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Thousands of test runs can't all hit GPT-4
- **Development**: Iterate on agent behavior without waiting for API responses
- **Demos**: Predictable responses for presentations and documentation

**Real LLMs for Accuracy:**

- **Integration testing**: Verify your prompts actually work with real models
- **Production**: Users need actual intelligence, not mock responses
- **Performance testing**: Measure real-world response times and error rates
- **Prompt engineering**: Optimize prompts against actual model behavior

#### Environment-Based Configuration

In practice, you'll want your agents to automatically choose the right LLM based on context:

```python
import os

def create_agent():
    """Smart agent creation based on environment"""
    
    if os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "test":
        # Testing: fast, predictable, no costs
        llm = MockLLMClient()
    elif os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "development":  
        # Development: cheaper models, faster iteration
        llm = OpenAIClient(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
        llm.model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Cheaper than GPT-4
    else:
        # Production: best quality available
        llm = OpenAIClient(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")) 
        llm.model = "gpt-4"  # Premium model for users
    
    return FlexibleAgent(llm)
```

This pattern - interface abstraction with dependency injection - is how professional software handles external services. Your agents become testable, flexible, and maintainable instead of brittle and hardcoded.

---

### Part 3: Tool Integration

#### Simple Tool Creation

Now we teach our agents how to take action in the world beyond generating text - the crucial step that transforms chatbots into useful systems.

![Agent Pattern Tool Integration](images/agent-pattern-tool-integration.png)

**File**: [`src/session1/tools.py`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/blob/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session1/tools.py) - Complete tool implementations

This SimpleTool base class solves the fundamental challenge of how to make different capabilities available to agents in a consistent way:

**⚠️ Security Warning**: The calculator example uses `eval()` which is dangerous! This implementation includes basic safety checks, but in production you should use a proper math expression parser like sympy or numexpr instead.

```python
class SimpleTool:
    def __init__(self, name: str, description: str):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
    
    def execute(self, input_data: str) -> str:
        """Override this method in specific tools"""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

This base class defines the interface that all tools must follow - just like how electrical appliances all use the same plug format. Each tool needs a name and description, plus an execute method.

Now let's implement a specific calculator tool with safety checks:

```python
class CalculatorTool(SimpleTool):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("calculator", "Performs basic math calculations")
    
    def execute(self, expression: str) -> str:
        """Safely evaluate math expressions"""
        try:
            # Basic safety check
            if any(char in expression for char in ['import', 'exec', 'eval', '__']):
                return "Invalid expression for security reasons"
            
            result = eval(expression)
            return f"Calculation result: {result}"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Math error: {e}"
```

Here's how to use the calculator tool:

```python

# Usage example

calc = CalculatorTool()
result = calc.execute("2 + 3 * 4")
print(result)  # "Calculation result: 14"
```

#### Tool Calling Mechanisms

Now we solve the challenge of how agents decide when and how to use tools - the difference between having tools and knowing when to use them.

**File**: [`src/session1/tool_use_agent.py`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/blob/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session1/tool_use_agent.py) - See the `ToolUseAgent` class

```python
class ToolUseAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {}
        self.memory = []
        
    def register_tool(self, tool: SimpleTool):
        """Add a tool to the agent's toolkit"""
        self.tools[tool.name] = tool
```

The ToolUseAgent starts with basic setup, maintaining a registry of available tools and conversation memory - like a craftsman organizing their workshop.

Now let's add the decision logic for when to use tools:

```python
    def should_use_tool(self, user_input: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:
        """Decide if we need a tool for this input"""
        # Simple keyword-based tool selection
        if any(word in user_input.lower() for word in ['calculate', 'math', '+', '-', '*', '/']):
            return True, 'calculator'
        return False, None
```

Finally, the main execution method that ties everything together:

```python
    def run(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        """Execute with tool usage"""
        needs_tool, tool_name = self.should_use_tool(user_input)
        
        if needs_tool and tool_name in self.tools:
            # Extract the calculation from the input
            # (In real implementation, use better parsing)
            tool_result = self.tools[tool_name].execute(user_input)
            return f"Using {tool_name}: {tool_result}"
        else:
            return f"I understand your request: {user_input}"
```

#### Basic Validation

Agents need quality control systems to ensure tool outputs are useful and reliable:

```python
def validate_tool_output(self, tool_name: str, output: str) -> bool:
    """Check if tool output looks reasonable"""
    if "error" in output.lower():
        return False
    if output.strip() == "":
        return False
    return True
```

This validation method helps agents determine if a tool executed successfully. It's part of the agent's quality control system, checking for common failure indicators like error messages or empty responses.

#### Integration Testing

Testing agents with tools verifies that the complete system works together correctly:

```python
def test_tool_integration():
    """Test agent + tool integration"""
    agent = ToolUseAgent()
    calc_tool = CalculatorTool()
    agent.register_tool(calc_tool)
    
    # Test tool usage
    response = agent.run("Calculate 15 + 27")
    assert "42" in response
    
    # Test non-tool usage
    response = agent.run("Hello there")
    assert "understand" in response
    
    print("✅ Tool integration tests passed!")
```

This integration test verifies that agents and tools work together correctly, testing the complete flow from user input through tool execution to final response.

### Part 4: Testing & Validation

#### Unit Testing Approaches

Testing is what separates hobby projects from production systems - it's how you build confidence that your agent will work correctly when it matters.

**File**: [`src/session1/test_agents.py`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/blob/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session1/test_agents.py) - Complete test suite

```python
import unittest

class TestAgentFunctionality(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures"""
        self.agent = SimpleAgent()
        self.tool_agent = ToolUseAgent()
        self.tool_agent.register_tool(CalculatorTool())
```

The test class starts with setup, creating agent instances and registering tools for consistent testing. This ensures each test starts with a clean, known state.

Now let's add the individual test methods:

```python
    def test_basic_responses(self):
        """Test basic agent responses"""
        response = self.agent.run("Hello")
        self.assertIsInstance(response, str)
        self.assertGreater(len(response), 0)
    
    def test_tool_integration(self):
        """Test tool usage"""
        response = self.tool_agent.run("What is 5 * 6?")
        self.assertIn("30", response)
```

Finally, the test runner:

```python

# Run tests

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

#### Common Troubleshooting

When agents don't work as expected, systematic debugging helps identify and fix issues quickly:

```python
def debug_agent_issues(agent, user_input):
    """Helper function to debug agent problems"""
    print(f"Input: {user_input}")
    print(f"Memory state: {len(agent.memory)} items")
    print(f"Available tools: {list(agent.tools.keys())}")
    
    try:
        response = agent.run(user_input)
        print(f"Response: {response}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error: {e}")
        print("Check input format and agent state")
```

#### Running Everything

Let's bring everything together in a comprehensive demonstration that showcases all the agent capabilities we've built:

**File**: [`src/session1/demo_runner.py`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/blob/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session1/demo_runner.py) - Complete demonstration

```python
def run_agent_demo():
    """Demonstrate all agent capabilities"""
    print("=== Bare Metal Agent Demo ===")
    
    # 1. Simple agent
    simple_agent = SimpleAgent()
    print("Simple Agent Response:", simple_agent.run("What is AI?"))
```

The demo starts by testing our basic SimpleAgent with a question to see how it responds.

Next, we test tool integration capabilities:

```python
    # 2. Tool-enabled agent
    tool_agent = ToolUseAgent()
    tool_agent.register_tool(CalculatorTool())
    print("Tool Agent Response:", tool_agent.run("Calculate 12 * 8"))
```

Finally, we demonstrate the advanced ReAct reasoning pattern:

```python
    # 3. ReAct agent
    react_agent = ReActAgent()  # From react_agent.py
    print("ReAct Agent working on complex task...")
    response = react_agent.run("Plan a simple Python project")
    print("ReAct Response:", response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_agent_demo()
```
