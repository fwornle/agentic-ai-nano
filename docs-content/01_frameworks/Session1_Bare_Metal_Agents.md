# Session 1: Bare Metal Agents - Building from First Principles

When processing terabytes of automotive test data across distributed cloud systems, you need complete control over agent behavior. Kubernetes orchestration requires precise resource management. Argo workflows demand deterministic execution patterns. Data pipeline reliability needs full transparency into every decision point. Compliance with GDPR and data protection laws requires auditable processing paths. This session teaches you to build AI agents from fundamental components - pure Python and direct LLM API calls - giving you the control needed for production data systems.

Understanding bare metal implementation is essential for engineers who orchestrate complex data pipelines, manage cloud costs, ensure data compliance, and maintain high-throughput processing systems that handle millions of sensor recordings daily.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- **Implement** core agent architectures using only Python and LLM APIs
- **Build** functional agents demonstrating all five agentic patterns (Reflection, Tool Use, ReAct, Planning, Multi-Agent)
- **Understand** the separation between model layer (LLM) and application layer (Python logic)
- **Create** agents that integrate with Kubernetes, Argo Workflows, and cloud data services
- **Debug** and optimize agent behavior for cost-effective cloud processing

## The Bare Metal Approach: Essential for Data Pipeline Control

### Technical Context & Requirements

Modern automotive data processing operates at massive scale. Consider a fleet validation system processing petabytes of sensor data: camera feeds, lidar point clouds, data stream recordings, all flowing through complex ML pipelines. Framework abstractions often hide critical details about resource consumption, API costs, and processing bottlenecks that directly impact your cloud budget and SLA compliance.

The bare metal approach provides the control needed for production data systems: predictable resource allocation in Kubernetes pods, transparent cost tracking for LLM API calls, and complete observability through Grafana dashboards - all essential for maintaining efficient data processing pipelines.

### Core Knowledge & Applications

You'll master fundamental patterns that power intelligent data orchestration, understand how to implement them within cloud resource constraints, and learn to integrate with existing data infrastructure like Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, S3, and Elasticsearch. This knowledge enables you to build agents that intelligently route data through processing pipelines, optimize batch sizes for cost efficiency, and automatically handle failures in distributed systems.

### Architectural Separation

The separation between model and application layers becomes critical in data processing contexts. The model layer handles intelligent decision-making about data routing and processing strategies, while the application layer manages concrete execution through Kubernetes jobs, database transactions, and API integrations. This separation allows you to swap LLM providers based on cost/performance trade-offs without touching your pipeline logic.

### Real-World Data Processing Applications

Engineering teams use bare metal agents for:
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Agents that dynamically route test data through appropriate ML models based on content analysis
- **Quality Assurance**: Systems that detect anomalies in sensor data and trigger reprocessing workflows
- **Cost Optimization**: Agents that analyze processing patterns and optimize resource allocation
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Systems that ensure data handling meets GDPR and automotive standards

## Core Implementation: Building Intelligence from First Principles

### Part 1: Agent Architecture Fundamentals

#### Basic Agent Structure

Every data processing agent requires these core components, designed for cloud-native deployment:

![Agent Pattern Control](images/agent-core-components.png)

**File**: [`src/session1/base_agent.py`](https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/blob/main/docs-content/01_frameworks/src/session1/base_agent.py)

This foundation class defines essential capabilities while respecting cloud resource limits. The memory management considers pod memory limits in Kubernetes, while the tool registry integrates with cloud services like S3, RDS, and message queues.

### Agent Architecture Foundation - BaseAgent Class

The BaseAgent class provides the architectural blueprint for data processing agents, addressing the challenge of intelligent orchestration within cloud infrastructure:

```python
class BaseAgent:
    """Foundation class for data pipeline agent implementations"""
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4", max_memory_mb=512):
        self.model_name = model_name      # LLM endpoint configuration
        self.memory = []                  # Processing context
        self.tools = {}                   # Cloud service integrations
        self.max_memory_mb = max_memory_mb  # Pod memory limit
        self.metrics_client = self._init_metrics()  # Prometheus metrics
```

**Memory System Design**: The memory list maintains processing context within Kubernetes pod limits. In production, this includes caching strategies for frequently accessed metadata, recent processing decisions, and error patterns - similar to how a data engineer tracks pipeline state across multiple workflow runs.

**Tool Registry Pattern**: The tools dictionary registers integrations with cloud services - S3 for data storage, PostgreSQL for metadata, Kafka for event streaming, and Argo for workflow orchestration. Each tool includes retry logic and circuit breakers for resilient cloud operations.

### Agent Execution Loop - Cloud-Native Processing Pipeline

The execution loop implements a robust processing pipeline suitable for distributed systems:

```python
    def run(self, input_data: dict, timeout_seconds: int = 30) -> dict:
        """Processing cycle with cloud resource management"""
        try:
            # Track API costs and latency
            with self.metrics_client.timer('agent_processing_time'):
                processed_input = self.process_input(input_data)
                action_plan = self.decide_action(processed_input)
                result = self.execute_action(action_plan)
                
                # Track LLM API costs
                self.metrics_client.increment('llm_api_calls', 
                    tags=['model:' + self.model_name])
                
                return self.format_response(result)
        except TimeoutError:
            return self.handle_timeout(input_data)
```

**Execution Flow Explanation**: Each step includes comprehensive monitoring for cloud cost optimization. The metrics integration enables real-time tracking through Grafana dashboards, allowing teams to balance processing speed against API costs.

### Key Concepts

Understanding these concepts is essential for cloud-based data processing:

1. **Model Interface**: Managing LLM API calls with rate limiting and cost tracking
2. **Memory Management**: Efficient caching within pod memory constraints
3. **Tool Registry**: Integration points for cloud services and data stores

#### Input/Output Handling

### Input Processing Pipeline - Multi-Format Data Handling

Data processing agents must handle diverse automotive data formats:

```python
    def process_input(self, data: Union[str, dict, bytes, pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
        """Standardize input from various data sources"""
        if isinstance(data, bytes):  # Binary sensor data
            return self.parse_rosbag_data(data)
        elif isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame):  # Structured test results
            return self.extract_dataframe_features(data)
        elif isinstance(data, dict) and 'stream_protocol' in data:  # Data stream messages
            return self.convert_stream_format(data)
        else:  # Natural language queries from engineers
            return {"type": "nl_query", "content": data}
```

### Pattern Implementation - Resilient Cloud Processing

Each pattern implementation considers distributed system challenges:

```python
    def decide_action(self, input_data: dict) -> dict:
        """Decision making with cost optimization"""
        # Estimate processing cost
        estimated_cost = self.estimate_processing_cost(input_data)
        
        if estimated_cost > self.cost_threshold:
            # Use cheaper model for simple tasks
            decision = self.llm_inference(input_data, model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
        else:
            # Use advanced model for complex analysis
            decision = self.llm_inference(input_data, model=self.model_name)
        
        # Validate against data processing rules
        if not self.validate_compliance(decision):
            decision = self.get_compliant_alternative()
            
        return decision
```

## Part 2: The Five Fundamental Agentic Patterns

### Agentic Patterns Overview

These five patterns form the foundation of intelligent data processing:

![Agentic Patterns](images/5-agent-patterns.png)

1. **Reflection**: Self-monitoring for pipeline optimization
2. **Tool Use**: Integration with cloud services and databases
3. **Planning**: Workflow orchestration and resource allocation
4. **ReAct**: Dynamic response to data anomalies
5. **Multi-Agent**: Coordination across distributed processing nodes

### Pattern 1: Reflection - Pipeline Performance Optimization

#### Concept

In data processing contexts, reflection enables agents to analyze their own performance and optimize pipeline efficiency:

```python
class ReflectiveAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Agent with self-monitoring for pipeline optimization"""
    
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4"):
        super().__init__(model_name)
        self.performance_history = []
        self.cost_tracker = CostTracker()
        self.optimization_threshold = 0.8
```

#### Implementation

The reflection mechanism monitors processing efficiency and triggers optimizations:

```python
    def reflect_on_performance(self, metrics: dict) -> dict:
        """Analyze pipeline performance and suggest optimizations"""
        reflection_prompt = f"""
        Analyze this data processing performance:
        - Throughput: {metrics['throughput_gb_per_hour']} GB/hour
        - Cost: ${metrics['cost_per_gb']} per GB
        - Error rate: {metrics['error_rate']}%
        - Queue depth: {metrics['queue_depth']} jobs
        
        Identify bottlenecks and suggest optimizations for:
        1. Resource allocation (CPU/memory)
        2. Batch size configuration
        3. Parallel processing strategy
        """
        
        optimization = self.llm_call(reflection_prompt)
        
        # Apply learnings to future processing
        self.update_processing_strategy(optimization)
        
        return optimization
```

### Pattern 2: Tool Use - Cloud Service Integration

#### Concept

Tool use in data processing means seamless integration with cloud infrastructure:

```python
class ToolUseAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Agent with cloud service integration capabilities"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_cloud_tools()
```

#### Tool Registration

Register tools for common data operations:

```python
    def register_cloud_tools(self):
        """Register cloud service interfaces"""
        self.tools = {
            "query_s3": self.query_s3_bucket,
            "execute_sql": self.execute_postgres_query,
            "trigger_argo": self.trigger_argo_workflow,
            "publish_kafka": self.publish_to_kafka,
            "search_elastic": self.search_elasticsearch,
            "update_grafana": self.update_grafana_annotation
        }
```

### Pattern 3: Planning - Workflow Orchestration

#### Concept

Planning agents orchestrate complex data processing workflows:

```python
class PlanningAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Agent for workflow orchestration"""
    
    def create_processing_plan(self, data_batch: dict) -> list:
        """Generate optimal processing plan for data batch"""
        planning_prompt = f"""
        Create processing plan for:
        - Data size: {data_batch['size_gb']} GB
        - Data types: {data_batch['sensor_types']}
        - Priority: {data_batch['priority']}
        - SLA: {data_batch['sla_hours']} hours
        
        Consider:
        - Available Kubernetes nodes: {self.get_available_nodes()}
        - Current queue depth: {self.get_queue_status()}
        - Cost budget: ${data_batch['budget']}
        
        Generate step-by-step workflow with resource allocation.
        """
        
        plan = self.llm_call(planning_prompt)
        return self.validate_resource_availability(plan)
```

### Pattern 4: ReAct - Adaptive Data Processing

#### Concept

ReAct pattern for dynamic response to data processing challenges:

```python
class ReActAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Agent implementing adaptive processing loop"""
    
    def process_with_reasoning(self, data_batch: dict, max_retries: int = 3):
        """Process data with reasoning and adaptation"""
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            thought = self.analyze_data_characteristics(data_batch)
            action = self.determine_processing_strategy(thought)
            observation = self.execute_processing(action)
            
            if self.processing_successful(observation):
                break
            
            # Adapt strategy based on failure
            data_batch = self.adjust_processing_params(observation)
        
        return self.get_processing_result()
```

### Pattern 5: Multi-Agent - Distributed Processing Coordination

#### Concept

Coordinate multiple specialized agents across the data pipeline:

```python
class DataPipelineCoordinator:
    """Coordinator for distributed processing agents"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {
            "ingestion": DataIngestionAgent(),
            "validation": QualityValidationAgent(),
            "transformation": DataTransformationAgent(),
            "ml_processing": MLProcessingAgent(),
            "storage": StorageOptimizationAgent()
        }
```

#### Coordination Protocol

Implement coordination across distributed processing:

```python
    def orchestrate_pipeline(self, data_batch: dict) -> dict:
        """Coordinate multi-agent data processing"""
        # Ingestion agent handles data intake
        ingested = self.agents["ingestion"].ingest_batch(data_batch)
        
        # Validation agent checks data quality
        validated = self.agents["validation"].validate_quality(ingested)
        
        # Transformation agent prepares for ML
        if validated["quality_score"] > 0.8:
            transformed = self.agents["transformation"].transform(validated)
        else:
            transformed = self.agents["transformation"].clean_and_transform(validated)
        
        # ML processing based on data type
        processed = self.agents["ml_processing"].process(transformed)
        
        # Storage optimization
        self.agents["storage"].store_optimized(processed)
        
        return processed
```

---

## Part 3: Production Considerations

### Cost Optimization for Cloud Deployment

Agents must operate within cloud budget constraints:

```python
class CostOptimizedAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Agent optimized for cloud cost management"""
    
    def __init__(self, monthly_budget: float = 10000):
        super().__init__()
        self.budget_tracker = BudgetTracker(monthly_budget)
        self.cost_per_token = 0.00002  # GPT-4 pricing
```

### Kubernetes Integration

Deploy agents as Kubernetes operators:

```python
    def deploy_as_k8s_operator(self):
        """Deploy agent as Kubernetes operator"""
        return {
            "apiVersion": "apps/v1",
            "kind": "Deployment",
            "metadata": {"name": "data-agent"},
            "spec": {
                "replicas": 3,
                "template": {
                    "spec": {
                        "containers": [{
                            "name": "agent",
                            "image": "data-agent:latest",
                            "resources": {
                                "requests": {"memory": "512Mi", "cpu": "500m"},
                                "limits": {"memory": "1Gi", "cpu": "1000m"}
                            }
                        }]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
```

### Monitoring and Observability

Implement comprehensive monitoring for production:

```python
    def setup_monitoring(self):
        """Configure Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards"""
        self.metrics = {
            "processing_throughput": Gauge('data_throughput_gbps'),
            "api_latency": Histogram('llm_api_latency_seconds'),
            "error_rate": Counter('processing_errors_total'),
            "cost_per_gb": Gauge('processing_cost_per_gb_dollars')
        }
```

## Practical Exercise: Building a Data Quality Agent

Let's build a complete agent for automotive data quality assurance:

```python
class DataQualityAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Production-ready agent for data quality monitoring"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(model_name="gpt-4")
        self.quality_rules = self.load_quality_rules()
        self.anomaly_detector = AnomalyDetector()
    
    def analyze_data_batch(self, batch_metadata: dict) -> dict:
        """Analyze data batch for quality issues"""
        # Check completeness
        completeness = self.check_data_completeness(batch_metadata)
        
        # Detect anomalies
        anomalies = self.anomaly_detector.detect(batch_metadata)
        
        # Generate quality report using LLM
        quality_prompt = self.build_quality_prompt(
            batch_metadata, completeness, anomalies
        )
        
        analysis = self.llm_call(quality_prompt)
        
        # Determine processing action
        action = self.determine_quality_action(analysis)
        
        return {
            "quality_score": self.calculate_quality_score(analysis),
            "issues_found": self.extract_issues(analysis),
            "recommended_action": action,
            "reprocessing_required": action in ["clean", "reject"],
            "cost_impact": self.estimate_reprocessing_cost(action)
        }
```
