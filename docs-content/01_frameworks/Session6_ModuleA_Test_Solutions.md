# Session 6 Module A - Test Solutions

## Advanced Composition Patterns - Answer Key

### Question 1: Pipeline Error Handling
### Correct Answer: C) Retry with exponential backoff and circuit breaker protection

**Explanation**: The PipelineOrchestrator implements sophisticated error handling with configurable retry policies, exponential backoff to prevent system overload, and circuit breaker integration to protect against cascading failures while maintaining pipeline reliability.

### Question 2: Load Distribution Algorithm
### Correct Answer: C) Workload calculation considering active tasks and agent capacity

**Explanation**: The ParallelProcessor uses intelligent workload calculation that considers each agent's current active tasks and capacity limits to ensure balanced load distribution and optimal resource utilization across the agent pool.

### Question 3: Dynamic Agent Selection Factors
### Correct Answer: B) Capability scores, performance metrics, and availability status

**Explanation**: The DynamicAssembly system performs multi-factor analysis including capability matching scores, historical performance metrics, and real-time availability status to select the most suitable agents for specific tasks.

### Question 4: CLI Status Information
### Correct Answer: B) Comprehensive execution details including stage status, timing, and error information

**Explanation**: The AtomicCLI provides comprehensive pipeline visibility with detailed stage execution status, timing information, error details, and performance metrics for effective monitoring and debugging.

### Question 5: Pipeline Reliability Mechanisms
### Correct Answer: B) Circuit breaker integration with configurable retry policies and failure tracking

**Explanation**: Advanced composition patterns ensure reliability through circuit breaker integration that prevents cascading failures, configurable retry policies for different error types, and comprehensive failure tracking for analysis and optimization.
