# Session 6 Module A - Test Solutions

## Advanced Composition Patterns - Answer Key

**Question 1:** Pipeline Error Handling

**Explanation**: The PipelineOrchestrator implements sophisticated error handling with configurable retry policies, exponential backoff to prevent system overload, and circuit breaker integration to protect against cascading failures while maintaining pipeline reliability.

**Question 2:** Load Distribution Algorithm

**Explanation**: The ParallelProcessor uses intelligent workload calculation that considers each agent's current active tasks and capacity limits to ensure balanced load distribution and optimal resource utilization across the agent pool.

**Question 3:** Dynamic Agent Selection Factors

**Explanation**: The DynamicAssembly system performs multi-factor analysis including capability matching scores, historical performance metrics, and real-time availability status to select the most suitable agents for specific tasks.

**Question 4:** CLI Status Information

**Explanation**: The AtomicCLI provides comprehensive pipeline visibility with detailed stage execution status, timing information, error details, and performance metrics for effective monitoring and debugging.

**Question 5:** Pipeline Reliability Mechanisms

**Explanation**: Advanced composition patterns ensure reliability through circuit breaker integration that prevents cascading failures, configurable retry policies for different error types, and comprehensive failure tracking for analysis and optimization.
