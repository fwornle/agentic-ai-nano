Session 4 - CrewAI Team Coordination Patterns (Course Version)
============================================================

Advanced team coordination patterns and collaborative workflows for CrewAI.
Demonstrates sophisticated agent communication, role delegation, and 
enterprise-scale team orchestration for data processing environments.

Key Patterns:
- Advanced role delegation and task handoff mechanisms
- Cross-functional team collaboration for complex projects
- Dynamic team formation and agent specialization
- Inter-agent communication and knowledge sharing
- Enterprise team patterns and governance structures
