# Session 1 - Module B: Performance Optimization

> **⚠️ ADVANCED OPTIONAL MODULE**
> Prerequisites: Complete Session 1 core content first.

At 3:47 AM, Netflix's AI-powered data processing infrastructure agent detected an anomalous data ingestion spike that could have cascaded into a $2.3 million streaming outage. Within 127 milliseconds, it had analyzed 15,000 pipeline metrics across their petabyte-scale data lake, executed corrective actions across 200 data processing nodes, and prevented what would have been a catastrophic recommendation engine failure. The difference between success and failure? Performance optimization patterns that most data engineers never learn.

While amateur data processing systems struggle with memory leaks and pipeline delays that frustrate analysts, enterprise-grade platforms must handle millions of concurrent data transformations with sub-second query response times. Spotify's real-time analytics engine processes 150 million streaming events per minute. Amazon's recommendation data pipeline manages petabytes of customer behavior data in real-time. These systems don't succeed by accident - they're engineered using the performance optimization patterns that separate prototype ETL jobs from production data powerhouses.

The harsh reality of enterprise data engineering: analysts abandon dashboards that take longer than 2 seconds to load, and memory inefficiency can cost companies thousands in cloud computing overhead daily. Master these optimization patterns, and you'll build data processing agents that don't just work - they scale to petabyte volumes.

## Part 1: Memory Management

### Efficient Memory Usage Patterns

🗂️ **File**: `src/session1/memory_optimized_agent.py` - Memory-efficient data processing agent implementations

Memory management is crucial for long-running data processing agents that need to maintain pipeline context without memory leaks while handling continuous data streams. The foundation is a structured approach to tracking memory usage in data-intensive operations:

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional
import sys
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@dataclass
class DataProcessingMemoryEntry:
    content: str
    timestamp: datetime
    importance_score: float
    size_bytes: int
    data_volume_gb: float  # Track data volume processed
    processing_stage: str  # ingestion, transformation, validation, etc.
```

The `DataProcessingMemoryEntry` dataclass tracks not just content but also metadata essential for intelligent memory management in data pipelines - when it was processed, how important it is, its memory footprint, and the volume of data it represents.

```python
class MemoryOptimizedDataAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Agent with intelligent memory management for long-running data processing operations"""

    def __init__(self, name: str, llm_client, max_memory_mb: float = 50.0):
        super().__init__(name, "Memory optimized data processing agent", llm_client)
        self.max_memory_bytes = max_memory_mb * 1024 * 1024  # Higher limit for data processing
        self.memory_entries: deque = deque(maxlen=5000)  # Higher limit for data operations
```

The agent uses a `deque` with a higher hard maximum to handle data processing context, while the configurable memory limit allows fine-tuning based on data volume requirements and deployment constraints.

```python
        self.importance_threshold = 0.6  # Higher threshold for data quality requirements
        self.cleanup_interval = 50       # More frequent cleanup for data processing
        self.processing_count = 0
        self.data_volume_processed = 0.0  # Track total data volume
```

The additional configuration parameters are tuned for data processing: higher importance threshold ensures quality data retention, more frequent cleanup handles continuous data streams, and volume tracking provides insights into processing scale.

### Data Processing History Optimization

The memory addition process includes proactive cleanup optimized for data processing workflows:

```python
def add_to_processing_memory(self, content: str, importance_score: float = 0.6,
                           data_volume_gb: float = 0.0, stage: str = "unknown"):
    """Add data processing content to memory with intelligent sizing and cleanup"""

    # Calculate memory footprint for data processing context
    content_size = sys.getsizeof(content)

    # Create data processing memory entry
    entry = DataProcessingMemoryEntry(
        content=content,
        timestamp=datetime.now(),
        importance_score=importance_score,
        size_bytes=content_size,
        data_volume_gb=data_volume_gb,
        processing_stage=stage
    )
```

Each entry tracks its actual memory footprint and the volume of data it represents, enabling precise memory management decisions based on both processing context and data scale metrics.

Next, the method implements proactive memory management optimized for data processing intervals:

```python
    # Check if cleanup is needed based on data processing frequency
    self.processing_count += 1
    self.data_volume_processed += data_volume_gb

    if self.processing_count % self.cleanup_interval == 0:
        self._cleanup_data_processing_memory()
```

Regular cleanup prevents memory from growing unchecked during continuous data processing. The processing counter triggers maintenance at predetermined intervals optimized for data pipeline frequency.

Finally, the method adds the entry and handles emergency cleanup situations:

```python
    # Add entry
    self.memory_entries.append(entry)

    # Force cleanup if memory limit exceeded during high-volume processing
    if self._get_total_memory_usage() > self.max_memory_bytes:
        self._aggressive_data_cleanup()
```

Regular cleanup prevents memory from growing unchecked, while emergency cleanup handles situations where memory limits are exceeded despite regular maintenance during high-volume data processing periods.

### Intelligent Data Processing Memory Cleanup

The cleanup method implements a sophisticated algorithm that balances importance, recency, and data processing stage priority:

```python
def _cleanup_data_processing_memory(self):
    """Intelligent memory cleanup based on importance, age, and data processing priorities"""

    if not self.memory_entries:
        return

    # Convert to list for easier manipulation
    entries_list = list(self.memory_entries)
```

First, the method checks for empty memory and converts the deque to a list for sorting operations optimized for data processing priorities.

Next, the algorithm sorts entries using a composite key that considers importance, chronological order, and data processing stage priority:

```python
    # Sort by importance, data volume, and processing stage priority
    stage_priorities = {
        "validation": 0.9,    # High priority - data quality issues
        "error": 0.8,         # High priority - processing errors
        "transformation": 0.7, # Medium-high priority - business logic
        "ingestion": 0.5,     # Medium priority - data intake
        "storage": 0.3        # Lower priority - archival operations
    }

    entries_list.sort(key=lambda x: (
        x.importance_score * 0.4 +
        stage_priorities.get(x.processing_stage, 0.2) * 0.4 +
        self._data_recency_score(x) * 0.2
    ))

    # Keep top 60% of entries (more aggressive for data processing)
    keep_count = int(len(entries_list) * 0.6)
    entries_to_keep = entries_list[-keep_count:]
```

The sorting prioritizes entries by importance (40%), processing stage priority (40%), and recency (20%), ensuring critical data processing context is preserved. Keeping 60% of entries provides more aggressive cleanup for continuous data processing operations.

Finally, the method updates the memory structure and logs the cleanup operation with data processing metrics:

```python
    # Update deque
    self.memory_entries.clear()
    for entry in entries_to_keep:
        self.memory_entries.append(entry)

    self.logger.info(f"Data processing memory cleanup: kept {len(entries_to_keep)} entries, "
                    f"total data volume tracked: {self.data_volume_processed:.2f} GB")

def _get_total_memory_usage(self) -> int:
    """Calculate total memory usage in bytes for data processing context"""
    return sum(entry.size_bytes for entry in self.memory_entries)
```

Utility methods track memory consumption by summing the size_bytes field of all entries, providing accurate memory usage data optimized for data processing operations.

### Comprehensive Data Processing Memory Statistics

The statistics method provides detailed analytics for data processing memory management optimization:

```python
def get_data_processing_memory_stats(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get comprehensive memory usage statistics for data processing operations"""
    total_entries = len(self.memory_entries)
    total_bytes = self._get_total_memory_usage()

    if total_entries > 0:
        avg_importance = sum(e.importance_score for e in self.memory_entries) / total_entries
        oldest_entry = min(self.memory_entries, key=lambda x: x.timestamp)
        newest_entry = max(self.memory_entries, key=lambda x: x.timestamp)

        # Calculate data processing specific metrics
        stage_distribution = {}
        for entry in self.memory_entries:
            stage = entry.processing_stage
            stage_distribution[stage] = stage_distribution.get(stage, 0) + 1
```

The method starts by collecting basic metrics and identifying temporal boundaries, plus data processing stage distribution to understand pipeline context retention patterns.

Next, it calculates comprehensive utilization and temporal metrics optimized for data processing:

```python
        return {
            "total_entries": total_entries,
            "total_memory_mb": total_bytes / (1024 * 1024),
            "avg_importance_score": avg_importance,
            "memory_utilization_pct": (total_bytes / self.max_memory_bytes) * 100,
            "oldest_entry_age_hours": (datetime.now() - oldest_entry.timestamp).total_seconds() / 3600,
            "memory_span_hours": (newest_entry.timestamp - oldest_entry.timestamp).total_seconds() / 3600,
            "total_data_volume_gb": self.data_volume_processed,
            "processing_stage_distribution": stage_distribution,
            "avg_data_volume_per_entry": sum(e.data_volume_gb for e in self.memory_entries) / total_entries
        }

    return {"total_entries": 0, "total_memory_mb": 0, "total_data_volume_gb": 0}
```

The statistics method provides comprehensive analytics including memory utilization percentages, data volume metrics, and processing stage distribution, enabling data-driven memory management decisions for data processing workloads.

### Context Compression Strategies for Data Processing

Context compression ensures optimal LLM performance by providing relevant data processing information within size constraints:

```python
def get_compressed_data_context(self, max_context_size: int = 4000) -> str:
    """Get compressed data processing context for LLM calls"""

    # Sort entries by importance, processing stage priority, and recency
    stage_priorities = {
        "validation": 0.9, "error": 0.8, "transformation": 0.7,
        "ingestion": 0.5, "storage": 0.3
    }

    sorted_entries = sorted(
        self.memory_entries,
        key=lambda x: (
            x.importance_score * 0.5 +
            stage_priorities.get(x.processing_stage, 0.2) * 0.3 +
            self._data_recency_score(x) * 0.2
        ),
        reverse=True
    )
```

The sorting algorithm weights importance highest (50%), then processing stage priority (30%), then recency (20%), ensuring critical data processing information is prioritized while still valuing recent pipeline context.

Next, the method builds the context string using a greedy packing approach optimized for data processing:

```python
    # Build context within size limit, prioritizing data processing insights
    context_parts = []
    current_size = 0

    for entry in sorted_entries:
        # Create enhanced context with data processing metadata
        enhanced_content = f"[{entry.processing_stage.upper()}] " \
                          f"({entry.data_volume_gb:.2f}GB processed) " \
                          f"{entry.content}"

        if current_size + len(enhanced_content) > max_context_size:
            break

        context_parts.append(enhanced_content)
        current_size += len(enhanced_content)
```

The packing algorithm enhances each entry with data processing metadata (stage and volume), maximizing the contextual value provided to the LLM for data engineering decisions.

Finally, the method handles truncation gracefully by informing the LLM about omitted data processing context:

```python
    # Add summary if we had to truncate, including data processing metrics
    if len(context_parts) < len(sorted_entries):
        truncated_count = len(sorted_entries) - len(context_parts)
        truncated_volume = sum(e.data_volume_gb for e in sorted_entries[len(context_parts):])
        summary = f"\n[... {truncated_count} earlier data processing entries truncated " \
                 f"({truncated_volume:.2f}GB additional data context omitted) ...]"
        context_parts.append(summary)

    return "\n".join(context_parts)
```

When truncation occurs, a clear summary informs the LLM that additional data processing context exists but was omitted, including the volume of data represented, helping it understand the full scope of pipeline operations.

```python
def _data_recency_score(self, entry: DataProcessingMemoryEntry) -> float:
    """Calculate recency score optimized for data processing timeline (1.0 = most recent, 0.0 = oldest)"""
    if not self.memory_entries:
        return 1.0

    oldest = min(self.memory_entries, key=lambda x: x.timestamp)
    newest = max(self.memory_entries, key=lambda x: x.timestamp)

    total_span = (newest.timestamp - oldest.timestamp).total_seconds()
    if total_span == 0:
        return 1.0

    entry_age = (newest.timestamp - entry.timestamp).total_seconds()
    return 1.0 - (entry_age / total_span)
```

The recency scoring normalizes timestamps to a 0-1 scale relative to the data processing timeline, ensuring fair comparison regardless of absolute time differences in data pipeline operations.

## Part 2: Tool Execution Speed

### Caching and Parallel Execution

🗂️ **File**: `src/session1/optimized_tools.py` - High-performance data processing tool implementations

Tool performance optimization combines intelligent caching with parallel execution capabilities optimized for data processing operations:

```python
import asyncio
from functools import lru_cache
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Callable
import hashlib
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed

class OptimizedDataProcessingToolAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Agent with high-performance tool execution for data processing operations"""

    def __init__(self, name: str, llm_client, tools: List[Tool]):
        super().__init__(name, "Optimized data processing tool agent", llm_client)
        self.tools = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}
        self.tool_cache = {}
        self.execution_stats = {}
        self.thread_pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8)  # Higher concurrency for data ops
        self.data_processing_metrics = {}  # Track data-specific metrics
```

The agent maintains separate caches and statistics for each tool, while the thread pool with higher concurrency enables parallel execution of data-intensive tool operations optimized for typical data processing workloads.

```python
    def _cache_key(self, tool_name: str, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Generate cache key for data processing tool execution"""
        # Create deterministic hash of tool name and parameters
        # Exclude timestamp-sensitive params for data processing
        cacheable_params = {k: v for k, v in params.items()
                           if k not in ['timestamp', 'execution_id', 'session_id']}
        param_str = str(sorted(cacheable_params.items()))
        cache_input = f"{tool_name}:{param_str}"
        return hashlib.md5(cache_input.encode()).hexdigest()
```

Caching uses deterministic hashing of tool names and parameters, excluding timestamp-sensitive parameters common in data processing to improve cache hit rates while maintaining data integrity.

```python
    def _is_cacheable(self, tool_name: str) -> bool:
        """Determine if data processing tool results should be cached"""
        # Don't cache tools that have side effects or time-dependent results
        non_cacheable = {
            "real_time_data_stream", "current_timestamp", "random_data_generator",
            "write_to_data_lake", "trigger_pipeline", "send_alert",
            "live_database_query", "streaming_analytics"
        }
        return tool_name not in non_cacheable
```

Intelligent caching excludes data processing tools with side effects or time-dependent results, preventing stale data while maximizing cache effectiveness for deterministic data operations like schema validation and transformation rules.

### Intelligent Tool Caching Implementation

The caching system balances performance gains with result freshness for data processing operations:

```python
async def execute_data_tool_cached(self, tool_name: str, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute data processing tool with intelligent caching"""

    start_time = time.time()

    # Check cache first for data processing operations
    if self._is_cacheable(tool_name):
        cache_key = self._cache_key(tool_name, params)
```

Each execution is timed for performance analysis, and cacheable data processing tools are checked for existing results before expensive re-execution.

The cache validation process includes TTL (Time-To-Live) checks tuned for data processing requirements:

```python
        if cache_key in self.tool_cache:
            cached_result = self.tool_cache[cache_key]
            # Shorter TTL for data processing (30 minutes) to ensure freshness
            if time.time() - cached_result["timestamp"] < 1800:
                execution_time = time.time() - start_time
                self._update_data_processing_stats(tool_name, execution_time, True)
                return cached_result["result"]
```

Cache validation includes shorter expiry checks (30-minute TTL) to balance performance gains with data freshness requirements critical in data processing pipelines. Cache hits are tracked in performance statistics to measure caching effectiveness.

When cache misses occur, the system executes the tool and stores results for future use:

```python
    # Execute data processing tool
    if tool_name not in self.tools:
        raise ValueError(f"Data processing tool {tool_name} not available")

    tool = self.tools[tool_name]
    result = await tool.execute(params)

    # Track data processing metrics
    if isinstance(result, dict) and 'data_volume_gb' in result:
        self._track_data_processing_metrics(tool_name, result)

    # Cache result if appropriate for data processing
    if self._is_cacheable(tool_name):
        self.tool_cache[cache_key] = {
            "result": result,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        }
```

Data processing tool execution includes tracking of data-specific metrics like volume processed, enabling optimization decisions based on actual data processing patterns.

Finally, performance statistics are updated regardless of cache hit or miss:

```python
    # Update performance stats
    execution_time = time.time() - start_time
    self._update_data_processing_stats(tool_name, execution_time, False)

    return result

def _update_data_processing_stats(self, tool_name: str, execution_time: float, cache_hit: bool):
    """Update tool execution statistics for data processing operations"""
    if tool_name not in self.execution_stats:
        self.execution_stats[tool_name] = {
            "total_calls": 0,
            "cache_hits": 0,
            "total_time": 0.0,
            "avg_time": 0.0,
            "total_data_processed_gb": 0.0
        }

    stats = self.execution_stats[tool_name]
    stats["total_calls"] += 1
    stats["total_time"] += execution_time
    stats["avg_time"] = stats["total_time"] / stats["total_calls"]

    if cache_hit:
        stats["cache_hits"] += 1
```

Performance statistics track execution times, call counts, cache hit rates, and data volumes per tool, enabling optimization decisions based on actual data processing usage patterns.

### Parallel Tool Execution

Parallel execution maximizes throughput when multiple data processing tools can run simultaneously:

```python
async def execute_data_tools_parallel(self, tool_requests: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Execute multiple data processing tools in parallel for better performance"""

    async def execute_single_data_tool(request):
        tool_name = request["tool"]
        params = request.get("params", {})
        try:
            result = await self.execute_data_tool_cached(tool_name, params)
            return {"success": True, "result": result, "tool": tool_name}
        except Exception as e:
            return {"success": False, "error": str(e), "tool": tool_name}
```

The parallel execution system handles multiple data processing tool requests concurrently, significantly reducing total execution time for independent data operations. Each tool execution is wrapped in error handling to prevent one failure from affecting other data processing operations.

Next, the method executes all requests concurrently using asyncio.gather optimized for data processing:

```python
    # Execute all data processing tool requests concurrently
    tasks = [execute_single_data_tool(request) for request in tool_requests]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

The `return_exceptions=True` parameter ensures that exceptions don't cancel other concurrent data processing operations, allowing partial success scenarios common in distributed data processing environments.

Finally, the method processes results and handles any exceptions that occurred:

```python
    # Handle any exceptions in data processing
    processed_results = []
    for result in results:
        if isinstance(result, Exception):
            processed_results.append({
                "success": False,
                "error": str(result),
                "tool": "unknown"
            })
        else:
            processed_results.append(result)

    return processed_results
```

### Performance Statistics Collection

Comprehensive performance tracking enables data-driven optimization decisions for data processing operations:

```python
def get_data_processing_performance_stats(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get comprehensive performance statistics for data processing operations"""
    total_calls = sum(stats["total_calls"] for stats in self.execution_stats.values())
    total_cache_hits = sum(stats["cache_hits"] for stats in self.execution_stats.values())
    total_data_processed = sum(stats.get("total_data_processed_gb", 0) for stats in self.execution_stats.values())

    cache_hit_rate = (total_cache_hits / total_calls * 100) if total_calls > 0 else 0

    return {
        "total_tool_calls": total_calls,
        "total_cache_hits": total_cache_hits,
        "cache_hit_rate_pct": cache_hit_rate,
        "total_data_processed_gb": total_data_processed,
        "tool_stats": dict(self.execution_stats),
        "cache_size": len(self.tool_cache),
        "thread_pool_size": self.thread_pool._max_workers,
        "avg_data_per_call_gb": total_data_processed / total_calls if total_calls > 0 else 0
    }
```

## Part 3: Response Time Optimization

### Faster Agent Responses

🗂️ **File**: `src/session1/fast_response_agent.py` - Speed-optimized data processing agent implementations

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
import time

class FastDataProcessingResponseAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Agent optimized for minimal response latency in data processing operations"""

    def __init__(self, name: str, llm_client):
        super().__init__(name, "Fast data processing response agent", llm_client)
        self.response_cache = {}
        self.precomputed_responses = {}
        self.response_times = []
        self.target_response_time = 1.5  # Tighter target for data processing
        self.data_processing_patterns = {}  # Track common data processing patterns
```

The agent initialization sets up caching infrastructure and tracks response times with a tighter target latency (1.5 seconds) optimized for data processing operations where analysts expect rapid feedback on data queries and transformations.

### Fast Data Processing Message Processing

The core processing method implements multiple optimization strategies tailored for data processing workflows:

```python
    async def process_data_message_fast(self, message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Process data processing message with speed optimizations"""
        start_time = time.time()

        # Check for exact match in data processing cache
        if message in self.response_cache:
            response = self.response_cache[message]
            response_time = time.time() - start_time
            self.response_times.append(response_time)
            return {
                "response": response,
                "response_time": response_time,
                "cache_hit": True,
                "data_processing_optimized": True
            }
```

The processing method starts with timing and immediately checks for exact cache matches, providing sub-millisecond responses for repeated data processing queries. All response times are tracked for performance analysis.

When exact matches aren't available, the system uses semantic matching for similar data processing queries:

```python
        # Check for similar data processing query (semantic matching)
        similar_response = self._find_similar_data_processing_response(message)
        if similar_response:
            response_time = time.time() - start_time
            self.response_times.append(response_time)
            return {
                "response": similar_response,
                "response_time": response_time,
                "cache_hit": "semantic",
                "data_processing_optimized": True
            }
```

When exact matches fail, semantic matching using data processing terminology finds responses to similar queries, significantly reducing response time while maintaining quality for related data engineering questions.

For new messages, the system uses timeout controls to ensure timely responses:

```python
        # Generate new response with timeout for data processing
        try:
            response = await asyncio.wait_for(
                self._generate_data_processing_response_with_context(message),
                timeout=self.target_response_time
            )
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            response = self._get_data_processing_fallback_response(message)

        # Cache the response
        self.response_cache[message] = response

        response_time = time.time() - start_time
        self.response_times.append(response_time)

        return {
            "response": response,
            "response_time": response_time,
            "cache_hit": False,
            "data_processing_optimized": True
        }
```

For new data processing messages, the system uses asyncio timeout to enforce response time limits. When LLM processing exceeds the target time, specialized fallback responses ensure data analysts always receive timely feedback.

### Semantic Matching Algorithm for Data Processing

The similarity detection system uses enhanced matching for data processing terminology:

```python
    def _find_similar_data_processing_response(self, message: str) -> Optional[str]:
        """Find cached response for similar data processing message using semantic matching"""
        message_words = set(message.lower().split())

        # Extract data processing keywords for enhanced matching
        data_keywords = {
            'etl', 'pipeline', 'transform', 'schema', 'query', 'database',
            'warehouse', 'lake', 'stream', 'batch', 'partition', 'join',
            'aggregate', 'filter', 'sort', 'group', 'index', 'optimize'
        }

        message_data_keywords = message_words & data_keywords

        best_match = None
        best_similarity = 0.0
```

The method starts by extracting data processing specific keywords to improve semantic matching accuracy for data engineering contexts.

Next, it iterates through all cached messages to find the best semantic match:

```python
        for cached_message, cached_response in self.response_cache.items():
            cached_words = set(cached_message.lower().split())
            cached_data_keywords = cached_words & data_keywords

            # Calculate enhanced similarity for data processing context
            word_similarity = len(message_words & cached_words) / len(message_words | cached_words) if message_words | cached_words else 0
            keyword_similarity = len(message_data_keywords & cached_data_keywords) / len(message_data_keywords | cached_data_keywords) if message_data_keywords | cached_data_keywords else 0

            # Weighted similarity (60% keywords, 40% general words)
            combined_similarity = (keyword_similarity * 0.6 + word_similarity * 0.4)

            if combined_similarity > 0.65 and combined_similarity > best_similarity:
                best_similarity = combined_similarity
                best_match = cached_response

        return best_match
```

The enhanced similarity algorithm weights data processing keywords higher (60%) than general words (40%) to improve matching accuracy for data engineering queries while preventing false matches.

```python
    def _get_data_processing_fallback_response(self, message: str) -> str:
        """Generate quick fallback response when data processing analysis times out"""
        fallback_responses = [
            "I'm analyzing your data processing request. Could you specify the data source or format you're working with?",
            "I understand you're asking about data processing. Let me provide initial guidance while I gather detailed pipeline recommendations.",
            "That's an interesting data engineering question. Here's what I can tell you immediately about this approach..."
        ]

        # Select fallback based on data processing message characteristics
        if any(keyword in message.lower() for keyword in ['pipeline', 'etl', 'transform']):
            return fallback_responses[0]
        elif any(keyword in message.lower() for keyword in ['optimize', 'performance', 'scale']):
            return fallback_responses[1]
        else:
            return fallback_responses[2]
```

### Performance Monitoring and Analytics

Comprehensive performance tracking enables data-driven optimization for data processing operations:

```python
def get_data_processing_response_time_stats(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get detailed response time analytics for data processing operations"""
    if not self.response_times:
        return {"no_data": True}

    sorted_times = sorted(self.response_times)
    n = len(sorted_times)
```

The analytics method starts by validating data availability and sorting response times for percentile calculations optimized for data processing performance analysis.

Next, it calculates comprehensive performance metrics:

```python
    return {
        "total_responses": n,
        "avg_response_time": sum(sorted_times) / n,
        "min_response_time": min(sorted_times),
        "max_response_time": max(sorted_times),
        "p50_response_time": sorted_times[n // 2],
        "p90_response_time": sorted_times[int(n * 0.9)],
        "p95_response_time": sorted_times[int(n * 0.95)],
        "responses_under_target": sum(1 for t in sorted_times if t < self.target_response_time),
        "target_achievement_rate": sum(1 for t in sorted_times if t < self.target_response_time) / n * 100,
        "cache_entries": len(self.response_cache),
        "data_processing_optimized": True
    }
```

The analytics provide comprehensive performance metrics including percentile distributions (P50, P90, P95) that are essential for understanding response time characteristics under different data processing load conditions.

### Automated Performance Optimization

The system automatically adjusts its behavior based on data processing performance metrics:

```python
async def optimize_data_processing_performance(self):
    """Automatically optimize agent performance based on data processing metrics"""
    stats = self.get_data_processing_response_time_stats()

    if stats.get("no_data"):
        return

    # Adjust target response time based on data processing performance
    if stats["target_achievement_rate"] > 95:
        # Performing well, can be more aggressive for data processing
        self.target_response_time *= 0.85
    elif stats["target_achievement_rate"] < 60:
        # Struggling with data processing, be more lenient
        self.target_response_time *= 1.15
```

The optimization algorithm adjusts targets based on actual performance: when achieving 95%+ success rate, it becomes more ambitious; when below 60%, it becomes more lenient, tuned for data processing expectations.

Finally, the system manages cache size to prevent memory issues during data processing operations:

```python
    # Clean cache if it's getting too large for data processing
    if len(self.response_cache) > 2000:  # Higher limit for data processing
        # Keep only most recent 1000 entries
        items = list(self.response_cache.items())
        self.response_cache = dict(items[-1000:])

    self.logger.info(f"Data processing performance optimization: "
                    f"target time {self.target_response_time:.2f}s, "
                    f"cache size {len(self.response_cache)}")
```
