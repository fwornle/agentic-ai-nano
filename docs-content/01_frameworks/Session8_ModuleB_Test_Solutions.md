# Session 8 - Module B: Test Solutions

## Enterprise Scaling & Architecture - Answer Key

**Question 1:** Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)  

**Explanation**: Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) allow you to create new resource types in Kubernetes beyond the built-in ones like Pods and Services. In our agent platform, CRDs enable us to define AgnoAgent resources with specific fields for agent configuration, scaling policies, and business logic that Kubernetes operators can then manage automatically.

**Question 2:** ResourceQuota Purpose  

**Explanation**: ResourceQuota objects are Kubernetes' way of implementing resource governance in multi-tenant environments. They set hard limits on CPU, memory, storage, and object counts per namespace, ensuring fair resource distribution and preventing any tenant from monopolizing cluster resources or causing denial-of-service to other tenants.

```yaml
"hard": {
    "requests.cpu": "10",
    "requests.memory": "20Gi",
    "limits.cpu": "20", 
    "limits.memory": "40Gi"
}
```

**Question 3:** Canary Traffic Distribution  

**Explanation**: The canary deployment configuration implements a conservative 90/10 traffic split by default. This allows gradual rollout of new agent versions while minimizing risk. The small 10% canary traffic provides real user feedback while maintaining service stability for the majority of requests through the proven stable version.

```yaml
"route": [
    {"destination": {"subset": "stable"}, "weight": 90},
    {"destination": {"subset": "canary"}, "weight": 10}
]
```

**Question 4:** Disaster Recovery Objectives  

**Explanation**: The disaster recovery plan sets aggressive targets: Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 hour means maximum 1 hour of data loss, while Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 30 minutes means service restoration within 30 minutes. These targets reflect enterprise requirements for high availability and business continuity in agent platforms.

**Question 5:** Emergency Cost Management  

**Explanation**: When budget remaining drops to 20% or below, the cost-aware scaling policy enters "emergency cost saving" mode. This dramatically reduces scaling capacity to 50% of normal levels and switches to 100% spot instances (cheapest option) to preserve remaining budget while maintaining minimal service levels.

```python
{
    "name": "emergency_cost_saving",
    "condition": "cost_budget_remaining <= 20%",
    "scaling_factor": 0.5,
    "spot_instance_ratio": 1.0
}
```

## Key Learning Points

**Enterprise Architecture**: Balances performance, cost, security, and reliability through comprehensive configuration management.

**Multi-Tenancy**: Requires careful resource isolation using namespaces, quotas, network policies, and RBAC.

**Service Mesh**: Provides advanced traffic management, security, and observability for distributed agent systems.

**Cost Optimization**: Implements intelligent scaling that adapts to budget constraints while maintaining service quality.

**Disaster Recovery**: Comprehensive planning with automated backup, replication, and failover ensures business continuity.
