## Security & Compliance - Answer Key

### Question 1: Zero-Trust Security Principle
### Correct Answer: B) Never trust, always verify every request regardless of source

**Explanation**: Zero-trust security architecture operates on the fundamental principle of "never trust, always verify." This means that every request, whether from internal or external sources, must be authenticated, authorized, and validated before access is granted. This approach eliminates the traditional network perimeter-based security model and treats every access attempt as potentially hostile.

### Question 2: GDPR Right to Erasure Article
### Correct Answer: C) Article 17 - Right to Erasure

**Explanation**: GDPR Article 17 specifically governs the "Right to Erasure" or "right to be forgotten," allowing data subjects to request deletion of their personal data under certain circumstances. The implementation includes legal feasibility assessment, comprehensive data removal, and third-party notification requirements as demonstrated in the compliance framework code.

### Question 3: Differential Privacy Mechanism
### Correct Answer: B) Calibrated mathematical noise using Laplace mechanism

**Explanation**: Differential privacy protects individual privacy by adding carefully calibrated mathematical noise to query results using mechanisms like Laplace noise. The noise scale is determined by the sensitivity of the query and the privacy budget (epsilon), providing formal mathematical guarantees about privacy protection while maintaining statistical utility.

### Question 4: High-Risk Threat Response Actions
### Correct Answer: C) block_temporarily, alert_security_team

**Explanation**: According to the threat detection system configuration, high-risk threats trigger response actions including temporary blocking of the threat source and alerting the security team. This balanced approach prevents immediate damage while allowing human expertise to assess and respond appropriately, avoiding the more severe permanent blocking reserved for critical threats.

### Question 5: K-Anonymity Privacy Technique
### Correct Answer: C) Generalization and suppression of quasi-identifiers

**Explanation**: K-anonymity is achieved through generalization (replacing specific values with broader categories) and suppression (removing identifying information) of quasi-identifiers. The anonymization process includes age group generalization, location region mapping, and direct identifier removal or pseudonymization to ensure each record is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records.
