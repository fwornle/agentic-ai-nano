# Session 2 - Module B: Production Deployment Strategies

> **‚ö†Ô∏è ADVANCED OPTIONAL MODULE**
> Prerequisites: Complete Session 2 core content first.

At 2:14 AM on a Thursday in December 2023, Netflix's data streaming infrastructure served 450 million concurrent user queries across their petabyte-scale analytics platform without a single service interruption. Behind this seamless experience was a sophisticated deployment architecture where 1,200+ data processing agents automatically scaled across global cloud regions, handled traffic spikes with intelligent load balancing, and maintained 99.99% uptime through self-healing recovery systems.

This wasn't luck - this was production-grade data engineering at global scale. When Spotify processes 500 billion streaming events daily, when Uber coordinates real-time location data across 10,000+ cities, or when Airbnb optimizes pricing algorithms across millions of listings, they rely on the same deployment patterns you're about to master: container orchestration, auto-scaling, circuit breakers, and distributed monitoring that transforms fragile data prototypes into bulletproof production systems.

The difference between a promising data engineering demo and a system that processes billions of data points reliably? Production deployment patterns that anticipate failure, optimize resource utilization, and scale seamlessly under the most demanding data workloads.

## Part 1: Container Orchestration & Scaling

### Docker Configuration for Data Systems

üóÇÔ∏è **File**: `src/session2/docker_deployment.py` - Container deployment orchestration

Production data applications require robust container orchestration to handle variable data processing loads and ensure reliable service delivery at scale:

```python
import docker
import asyncio
import yaml
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
import logging
import json
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

@dataclass
class ContainerConfig:
    """Configuration for data processing container deployment"""
    name: str
    image: str
    environment: Dict
