# Session 2 - Module B: Production Deployment Strategies

> **⚠️ ADVANCED OPTIONAL MODULE**  
> Prerequisites: Complete Session 2 core content first.

At 2:14 AM on a Thursday in December 2023, Netflix's data streaming infrastructure served 450 million concurrent user queries across their petabyte-scale analytics platform without a single service interruption. Behind this seamless experience was a sophisticated deployment architecture where 1,200+ data processing agents automatically scaled across global cloud regions, handled traffic spikes with intelligent load balancing, and maintained 99.99% uptime through self-healing recovery systems.

This wasn't luck - this was production-grade data engineering at global scale. When Spotify processes 500 billion streaming events daily, when Uber coordinates real-time location data across 10,000+ cities, or when Airbnb optimizes pricing algorithms across millions of listings, they rely on the same deployment patterns you're about to master: container orchestration, auto-scaling, circuit breakers, and distributed monitoring that transforms fragile data prototypes into bulletproof production systems.

The difference between a promising data engineering demo and a system that processes billions of data points reliably? Production deployment patterns that anticipate failure, optimize resource utilization, and scale seamlessly under the most demanding data workloads.

## Part 1: Container Orchestration & Scaling

### Docker Configuration for Data Systems

🗂️ **File**: `src/session2/docker_deployment.py` - Container deployment orchestration

Production data applications require robust container orchestration to handle variable data processing loads and ensure reliable service delivery at scale:

```python
import docker
import asyncio
import yaml
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
import logging
import json
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

@dataclass
class ContainerConfig:
    """Configuration for data processing container deployment"""
    name: str
    image: str
    environment: Dict[str, str]
    resources: Dict[str, str]
    ports: List[str]
    volumes: List[str]
    restart_policy: str = "unless-stopped"
    health_check: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```

The ContainerConfig dataclass provides structured container configuration for data processing applications. Resource limits, health checks, and restart policies ensure reliable data service deployment with proper resource management.

```python
class DataProcessingOrchestrator:
    """Orchestrates containerized data processing services with scaling and monitoring"""
    
    def __init__(self, cluster_config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.cluster_config = cluster_config
        self.docker_client = docker.from_env()
        self.deployed_services = {}
        self.resource_monitor = ResourceMonitor()
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
        # Load balancer configuration for data services
        self.load_balancer_config = {
            "algorithm": "round_robin",
            "health_check_interval": 30,
            "max_retries": 3,
            "backend_timeout": 300
        }
```

The orchestrator initializes Docker client connections and resource monitoring for data processing services. Load balancer configuration ensures efficient traffic distribution across data service instances with appropriate timeouts for data-intensive operations.

```python        
        # Auto-scaling configuration for data workloads
        self.scaling_config = {
            "min_instances": cluster_config.get("min_instances", 2),
            "max_instances": cluster_config.get("max_instances", 20),
            "cpu_threshold": cluster_config.get("cpu_threshold", 75),
            "memory_threshold": cluster_config.get("memory_threshold", 80),
            "scale_up_cooldown": cluster_config.get("scale_up_cooldown", 300),
            "scale_down_cooldown": cluster_config.get("scale_down_cooldown", 600)
        }
```

Auto-scaling configuration defines resource thresholds and cooldown periods for data processing workloads. Conservative scaling parameters prevent thrashing while ensuring responsive capacity management during data processing spikes.

### Service Deployment and Management

Comprehensive service deployment handles container lifecycle, health monitoring, and automatic recovery for data processing resilience:

```python
async def deploy_data_service(self, service_name: str, container_config: ContainerConfig) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Deploy containerized data service with health monitoring"""
    
    try:
        self.logger.info(f"Deploying data service: {service_name}")
        
        # Prepare container environment for data processing
        container_env = container_config.environment.copy()
        container_env.update({
            "SERVICE_NAME": service_name,
            "DEPLOYMENT_TIME": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "CLUSTER_ID": self.cluster_config.get("cluster_id", "default"),
            "DATA_PROCESSING_MODE": "production"
        })
```

Service deployment preparation enriches container environment with deployment metadata and data processing configuration. Service identification and timing information support monitoring and debugging of data processing services.

```python        
        # Create data processing container
        container = self.docker_client.containers.run(
            image=container_config.image,
            name=f"{service_name}_{int(time.time())}",
            environment=container_env,
            ports={port: port for port in container_config.ports},
            volumes=[vol for vol in container_config.volumes],
            restart_policy={"Name": container_config.restart_policy},
            detach=True,
            remove=False,
            mem_limit=container_config.resources.get("memory", "1g"),
            cpu_quota=int(container_config.resources.get("cpu_quota", "100000")),
            health_check=container_config.health_check
        )
```

Container creation with comprehensive resource limits and health check configuration ensures reliable data processing service deployment. Memory limits and CPU quotas prevent resource exhaustion while health checks enable automatic recovery.

```python        
        # Wait for data service to become healthy
        health_status = await self._wait_for_service_health(container, timeout=120)
        
        if health_status["healthy"]:
            service_info = {
                "container_id": container.id,
                "container_name": container.name,
                "status": "running",
                "deployment_time": datetime.now(),
                "health_check_url": f"http://localhost:{container_config.ports[0]}/health",
                "metrics_url": f"http://localhost:{container_config.ports[0]}/metrics"
            }
            
            self.deployed_services[service_name] = service_info
            
            return {
                "success": True,
                "service_name": service_name,
                "service_info": service_info,
                "message": f"Data service {service_name} deployed successfully"
            }
```

Health check verification and service registration complete deployment process. Successful deployment updates service registry with monitoring endpoints while failed deployments trigger cleanup procedures for data service reliability.

```python        
        else:
            # Clean up failed data service deployment
            container.stop()
            container.remove()
            
            return {
                "success": False,
                "service_name": service_name,
                "error": f"Data service {service_name} failed health checks",
                "health_details": health_status
            }
            
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Data service deployment failed: {str(e)}")
        return {
            "success": False,
            "service_name": service_name,
            "error": str(e)
        }
```

Error handling ensures clean failure recovery with detailed error reporting. Failed deployments trigger container cleanup while comprehensive error details support troubleshooting and data service deployment debugging.

### Health Monitoring and Service Discovery

Health monitoring system provides continuous service health assessment and automatic recovery for data processing service reliability:

```python
async def _wait_for_service_health(self, container, timeout: int = 120) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Wait for data service to pass health checks"""
    
    start_time = time.time()
    health_attempts = 0
    max_health_attempts = timeout // 5  # Check every 5 seconds
    
    while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
        try:
            health_attempts += 1
            container.reload()  # Refresh container status
            
            # Check container is still running
            if container.status != "running":
                return {
                    "healthy": False,
                    "reason": f"Container stopped with status: {container.status}",
                    "attempts": health_attempts
                }
```

Health check initialization establishes timeout parameters and retry logic for data service monitoring. Container status validation ensures service availability while attempt counting provides debugging information.

```python            
            # Execute container health check
            if hasattr(container, 'health'):
                health_status = container.health
                if health_status == "healthy":
                    return {
                        "healthy": True,
                        "reason": "Health check passed",
                        "attempts": health_attempts,
                        "response_time": time.time() - start_time
                    }
```

Docker health check integration leverages native container health monitoring. Successful health checks return detailed timing information while failed checks continue retry logic with backoff.

```python            
            # Custom health check via HTTP endpoint for data services
            try:
                ports = container.attrs['NetworkSettings']['Ports']
                if ports:
                    port = list(ports.keys())[0].split('/')[0]
                    health_url = f"http://localhost:{port}/health"
                    
                    import requests
                    response = requests.get(health_url, timeout=5)
                    
                    if response.status_code == 200:
                        health_data = response.json()
                        
                        return {
                            "healthy": True,
                            "reason": "HTTP health check passed",
                            "attempts": health_attempts,
                            "health_data": health_data,
                            "response_time": time.time() - start_time
                        }
            except:
                pass  # Continue with retry logic
```

Custom HTTP health check provides application-level health validation for data processing services. Health endpoint responses include service-specific metrics while connection failures trigger continued retry attempts.

```python            
            await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Wait before next health check
            
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.warning(f"Health check attempt {health_attempts} failed: {str(e)}")
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
    
    return {
        "healthy": False,
        "reason": "Health check timeout exceeded",
        "attempts": health_attempts,
        "timeout": timeout
    }
```

Health check timeout handling ensures deployment process completion even with failing services. Timeout conditions return comprehensive diagnostic information for troubleshooting data service deployment issues.

### Auto-scaling Implementation

Auto-scaling system monitors resource utilization and automatically adjusts data processing service capacity based on demand patterns:

```python
async def monitor_and_scale_services(self):
    """Continuous monitoring and auto-scaling for data processing services"""
    
    self.logger.info("Starting data service auto-scaling monitor")
    
    while True:
        try:
            for service_name, service_info in self.deployed_services.items():
                # Get current resource utilization for data service
                resource_stats = await self._get_service_resource_stats(service_name)
```
Auto-scaling monitor continuously evaluates resource utilization across deployed data processing services. Service iteration ensures all active services receive scaling evaluation while resource statistics collection provides utilization metrics.

```python
                if resource_stats:
                    scaling_decision = self._evaluate_scaling_decision(service_name, resource_stats)
                    
                    if scaling_decision["action"] == "scale_up":
                        await self._scale_up_service(service_name, scaling_decision["target_instances"])
                    elif scaling_decision["action"] == "scale_down":
                        await self._scale_down_service(service_name, scaling_decision["target_instances"])
```
Scaling decision evaluation determines optimal capacity adjustments based on resource utilization patterns. Scale-up and scale-down operations maintain service performance while optimizing resource costs for data processing workloads.

Scaling monitor continuously evaluates resource utilization across deployed data processing services. Resource statistics collection and scaling decision evaluation ensure optimal capacity management for varying data processing workloads.

```python                        
            await asyncio.sleep(self.scaling_config["scale_up_cooldown"])  # Cooldown between scaling evaluations
            
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Auto-scaling monitor error: {str(e)}")
            await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Wait before retry on error
```
Cooldown periods prevent scaling thrashing while error handling ensures monitor resilience during transient failures. Extended retry intervals allow system recovery before resuming scaling operations.

```python
def _evaluate_scaling_decision(self, service_name: str, resource_stats: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Evaluate if data service needs scaling based on resource utilization"""
    
    cpu_usage = resource_stats.get("cpu_percent", 0)
    memory_usage = resource_stats.get("memory_percent", 0)
    current_instances = resource_stats.get("instance_count", 1)
```
Scaling evaluation extracts resource utilization metrics from service statistics for decision making. CPU and memory usage provide capacity indicators while instance counts enable scaling boundary enforcement.

```python
    # Check for scale up conditions
    if (cpu_usage > self.scaling_config["cpu_threshold"] or 
        memory_usage > self.scaling_config["memory_threshold"]):
        
        if current_instances < self.scaling_config["max_instances"]:
            target_instances = min(current_instances + 1, self.scaling_config["max_instances"])
            return {
                "action": "scale_up",
                "target_instances": target_instances,
                "reason": f"High resource usage - CPU: {cpu_usage}%, Memory: {memory_usage}%"
            }
```
Scale-up evaluation compares resource utilization against configured thresholds for data processing services. Instance limit enforcement prevents runaway scaling while detailed reasoning supports scaling decision audit trails.

Scaling decision evaluation compares resource utilization against configured thresholds for data processing services. Scale-up decisions consider both CPU and memory usage while respecting maximum instance limits.

```python    
    # Check for scale down conditions (conservative approach)
    if (cpu_usage < self.scaling_config["cpu_threshold"] * 0.5 and 
        memory_usage < self.scaling_config["memory_threshold"] * 0.5):
        
        if current_instances > self.scaling_config["min_instances"]:
            target_instances = max(current_instances - 1, self.scaling_config["min_instances"])
            return {
                "action": "scale_down", 
                "target_instances": target_instances,
                "reason": f"Low resource usage - CPU: {cpu_usage}%, Memory: {memory_usage}%"
            }
```
Scale-down evaluation uses conservative thresholds (50% of scale-up limits) to prevent capacity oscillation during data processing workloads. Minimum instance enforcement ensures service availability while gradual capacity reduction optimizes costs.

```python
    return {"action": "no_change", "reason": "Resource usage within normal ranges"}
```
Default no-change response maintains current capacity when resource utilization falls within acceptable operational ranges. This conservative approach ensures service stability during normal operating conditions.

Scale-down evaluation uses conservative thresholds to prevent capacity thrashing during data processing workloads. Minimum instance limits ensure service availability while low resource usage triggers gradual capacity reduction.

## Part 2: Load Balancing & High Availability

### Advanced Load Balancing for Data Services

🗂️ **File**: `src/session2/load_balancing.py` - Load balancing and traffic management

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import hashlib
import time
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional, Tuple
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from enum import Enum
import logging
import json
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import statistics

class LoadBalancingAlgorithm(Enum):
    """Load balancing algorithms for data processing services"""
    ROUND_ROBIN = "round_robin"
    WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN = "weighted_round_robin"
    LEAST_CONNECTIONS = "least_connections"
    LEAST_RESPONSE_TIME = "least_response_time"
    CONSISTENT_HASHING = "consistent_hashing"
    DATA_LOCALITY_AWARE = "data_locality_aware"
```

LoadBalancingAlgorithm enum defines data service load balancing strategies. Data locality awareness and response time optimization ensure efficient data processing service utilization with minimal network overhead.

```python
@dataclass
class DataServiceBackend:
    """Backend data service configuration with health and performance metrics"""
    host: str
    port: int
    weight: int = 1
    max_connections: int = 100
    current_connections: int = 0
    healthy: bool = True
    last_health_check: datetime = field(default_factory=datetime.now)
    response_times: List[float] = field(default_factory=list)
    data_processing_capacity: int = 1000  # requests per second
    data_affinity_tags: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)  # e.g., ["region-us-east", "dataset-customer-data"]
    
    @property
    def avg_response_time(self) -> float:
        """Calculate average response time for performance-based routing"""
        if not self.response_times:
            return 0.0
        return statistics.mean(self.response_times[-100:])  # Last 100 requests
    
    @property
    def endpoint(self) -> str:
        """Get full endpoint URL for data service"""
        return f"http://{self.host}:{self.port}"
```

DataServiceBackend class tracks comprehensive service metrics for intelligent load balancing. Response time tracking, connection counts, and data affinity tags enable sophisticated routing decisions for data processing services.

```python
class AdvancedDataLoadBalancer:
    """Advanced load balancer with data-aware routing and circuit breaking"""
    
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.config = config
        self.backends: List[DataServiceBackend] = []
        self.algorithm = LoadBalancingAlgorithm(config.get("algorithm", "round_robin"))
        self.circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(config.get("circuit_breaker", {}))
        
        # Health monitoring configuration
        self.health_check_interval = config.get("health_check_interval", 30)
        self.health_check_timeout = config.get("health_check_timeout", 5)
        self.max_failed_health_checks = config.get("max_failed_health_checks", 3)
        
        # Performance tracking
        self.performance_window = config.get("performance_window", 300)  # 5 minutes
        self.request_history = []
        
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        self._current_backend_index = 0
        self._lock = asyncio.Lock()
```

AdvancedDataLoadBalancer initialization configures multiple load balancing algorithms and circuit breaking for data service resilience. Health monitoring and performance tracking enable intelligent routing decisions.

```python        
        # Start background health monitoring for data services
        asyncio.create_task(self._health_monitor_loop())
    
    def add_backend(self, backend: DataServiceBackend):
        """Add data service backend to load balancer pool"""
        self.backends.append(backend)
        self.logger.info(f"Added data service backend: {backend.endpoint}")
    
    def remove_backend(self, backend_endpoint: str):
        """Remove data service backend from load balancer pool"""
        self.backends = [b for b in self.backends if b.endpoint != backend_endpoint]
        self.logger.info(f"Removed data service backend: {backend_endpoint}")
```

Backend management functions provide dynamic service pool administration. Add and remove operations enable automatic service discovery integration while maintaining load balancer state consistency.

### Intelligent Backend Selection

Advanced backend selection implements multiple algorithms optimized for different data processing scenarios:

```python
async def select_backend(self, request_data: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> Optional[DataServiceBackend]:
    """Select optimal backend based on configured algorithm and request characteristics"""
    
    # Filter healthy backends for data processing
    healthy_backends = [b for b in self.backends if b.healthy and not self.circuit_breaker.is_open(b.endpoint)]
    
    if not healthy_backends:
        self.logger.error("No healthy data service backends available")
        return None
```

Backend selection begins with health filtering to ensure only available data services participate in routing decisions. Circuit breaker integration prevents routing to failing services.

```python    
    async with self._lock:
        if self.algorithm == LoadBalancingAlgorithm.ROUND_ROBIN:
            return self._round_robin_selection(healthy_backends)
        
        elif self.algorithm == LoadBalancingAlgorithm.WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN:
            return self._weighted_round_robin_selection(healthy_backends)
        
        elif self.algorithm == LoadBalancingAlgorithm.LEAST_CONNECTIONS:
            return self._least_connections_selection(healthy_backends)
        
        elif self.algorithm == LoadBalancingAlgorithm.LEAST_RESPONSE_TIME:
            return self._least_response_time_selection(healthy_backends)
        
        elif self.algorithm == LoadBalancingAlgorithm.CONSISTENT_HASHING:
            return self._consistent_hashing_selection(healthy_backends, request_data)
        
        elif self.algorithm == LoadBalancingAlgorithm.DATA_LOCALITY_AWARE:
            return self._data_locality_aware_selection(healthy_backends, request_data)
        
        else:
            return healthy_backends[0] if healthy_backends else None
```

Algorithm dispatcher routes to specialized selection methods with request context. Data locality awareness and consistent hashing provide advanced routing capabilities for data processing optimization.

```python
def _data_locality_aware_selection(self, backends: List[DataServiceBackend], 
                                  request_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> DataServiceBackend:
    """Select backend based on data locality and affinity for optimal processing"""
    
    if not request_data:
        return self._least_response_time_selection(backends)
    
    # Extract data affinity requirements from request
    required_tags = request_data.get("data_affinity_tags", [])
    dataset_id = request_data.get("dataset_id", "")
    processing_type = request_data.get("processing_type", "")
```

Data locality selection extracts affinity requirements from requests to optimize data processing placement. Dataset identification and processing type information guide intelligent backend selection for minimal data transfer.

```python    
    # Score backends based on data affinity match
    backend_scores = []
    for backend in backends:
        score = 0
        
        # Exact tag matches get highest priority for data processing
        matching_tags = set(required_tags) & set(backend.data_affinity_tags)
        score += len(matching_tags) * 10
        
        # Processing capacity consideration
        if backend.current_connections < backend.max_connections * 0.8:
            score += 5
        
        # Response time performance factor
        if backend.avg_response_time > 0:
            score += max(0, 10 - backend.avg_response_time)  # Faster services get higher scores
        
        backend_scores.append((backend, score))
```

Backend scoring combines data affinity, capacity availability, and performance metrics. Tag matching prioritizes data locality while capacity and response time ensure optimal data processing performance.

```python    
    # Select backend with highest affinity score
    if backend_scores:
        backend_scores.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        selected_backend = backend_scores[0][0]
        
        self.logger.debug(f"Data locality selection: {selected_backend.endpoint} (score: {backend_scores[0][1]})")
        return selected_backend
    
    # Fallback to least response time if no affinity data available
    return self._least_response_time_selection(backends)
```

Score-based selection returns the optimal backend for data locality while fallback logic ensures service availability. Logging provides visibility into data locality routing decisions for debugging and optimization.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation

Circuit breaker pattern protects data processing services from cascade failures and provides graceful degradation during service outages:

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    """Circuit breaker for data service protection and failure isolation"""
    
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.failure_threshold = config.get("failure_threshold", 5)
        self.recovery_timeout = config.get("recovery_timeout", 60)
        self.success_threshold = config.get("success_threshold", 3)
        
        # Track circuit state per data service endpoint
        self.circuit_states: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```
CircuitBreaker initialization establishes failure thresholds and recovery timeouts for data service protection. Circuit state tracking maintains individual service status while configurable thresholds adapt to service characteristics.

```python
    def is_open(self, service_endpoint: str) -> bool:
        """Check if circuit is open (blocking requests) for data service"""
        
        state = self.circuit_states.get(service_endpoint, {
            "status": "closed",
            "failure_count": 0,
            "last_failure_time": None,
            "success_count": 0
        })
```
Circuit state checking initializes default closed state for new services with zero failure counts. State management per endpoint enables granular circuit breaker protection across distributed data processing services.

```python
        if state["status"] == "open":
            # Check if recovery timeout has passed for data service
            if (datetime.now() - state["last_failure_time"]).total_seconds() > self.recovery_timeout:
                state["status"] = "half_open"
                state["success_count"] = 0
                self.circuit_states[service_endpoint] = state
                self.logger.info(f"Circuit breaker half-open for data service: {service_endpoint}")
                
        return state["status"] == "open"
```
Recovery timeout evaluation transitions open circuits to half-open state for recovery testing. Half-open circuits allow limited traffic to determine service recovery while maintaining protection against continuous failures.

Circuit breaker state management tracks failure counts and recovery timeouts per data service. Open circuits block requests while half-open circuits allow limited traffic for recovery testing.

```python    
    def record_success(self, service_endpoint: str):
        """Record successful data service request"""
        
        state = self.circuit_states.get(service_endpoint, {
            "status": "closed",
            "failure_count": 0,
            "last_failure_time": None,
            "success_count": 0
        })
```
Success recording initializes circuit state for new services with default healthy status. State management ensures consistent tracking across all data processing services.

```python
        if state["status"] == "half_open":
            state["success_count"] += 1
            if state["success_count"] >= self.success_threshold:
                state["status"] = "closed"
                state["failure_count"] = 0
                self.logger.info(f"Circuit breaker closed for recovered data service: {service_endpoint}")
        else:
            state["failure_count"] = max(0, state["failure_count"] - 1)  # Gradually reduce failure count
        
        self.circuit_states[service_endpoint] = state
```
Half-open circuit success counting enables recovery confirmation with configurable success thresholds. Closed circuits receive gradual failure count reduction while successful recovery transitions circuits to fully operational status.

Success recording implements recovery logic for data services with graduated failure count reduction. Half-open circuits transition to closed after sufficient successful requests indicating service recovery.

```python    
    def record_failure(self, service_endpoint: str):
        """Record failed data service request and evaluate circuit opening"""
        
        state = self.circuit_states.get(service_endpoint, {
            "status": "closed",
            "failure_count": 0,
            "last_failure_time": None,
            "success_count": 0
        })
        
        state["failure_count"] += 1
        state["last_failure_time"] = datetime.now()
```
Failure recording increments failure counts and timestamps the latest failure for recovery timeout calculation. This information enables precise circuit breaker state transitions based on failure patterns.

```python
        if state["failure_count"] >= self.failure_threshold:
            if state["status"] != "open":
                state["status"] = "open"
                self.logger.warning(f"Circuit breaker opened for failing data service: {service_endpoint}")
        
        self.circuit_states[service_endpoint] = state
```
Threshold evaluation triggers circuit opening when failure counts exceed configured limits. Circuit opening protects data processing infrastructure by preventing continued requests to failing services while maintaining detailed failure tracking.

Failure recording increments failure counts and opens circuits when thresholds are exceeded. Circuit opening protects data processing infrastructure from repeatedly attempting to use failing services.

import json
import aiohttp
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import threading
```
Supporting imports enable metrics collection infrastructure with datetime for temporal tracking, aiohttp for service communication, and threading for concurrent monitoring operations.

```python
@dataclass
class DataServiceMetrics:
    """Comprehensive metrics for data processing services"""
    
    # Request metrics
    total_requests: Counter = field(default_factory=lambda: Counter(
        'data_service_requests_total', 
        'Total requests to data processing services',
        ['service_name', 'endpoint', 'method', 'status']
    ))
    
    request_duration: Histogram = field(default_factory=lambda: Histogram(
        'data_service_request_duration_seconds',
        'Request duration for data processing services', 
        ['service_name', 'endpoint', 'method'],
        buckets=[0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 30.0, 60.0, 120.0]
    ))
```
Request metrics track total requests and response times across data processing services. Label dimensions enable detailed analysis by service, endpoint, and method while histogram buckets capture response time distributions for performance analysis.

```python
    # Data processing metrics
    data_processing_throughput: Counter = field(default_factory=lambda: Counter(
        'data_processing_records_total',
        'Total data records processed',
        ['service_name', 'dataset_type', 'processing_stage']
    ))
    
    data_processing_latency: Histogram = field(default_factory=lambda: Histogram(
        'data_processing_latency_seconds',
        'Data processing latency by operation',
        ['service_name', 'operation_type'],
        buckets=[0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 30.0]
    ))
```
Data processing metrics capture throughput and latency for comprehensive performance monitoring. Record counting enables capacity planning while latency histograms identify processing bottlenecks across different operation types.

DataServiceMetrics class defines comprehensive Prometheus metrics for data processing services. Request tracking, processing throughput, and latency histograms provide complete visibility into data service performance.

```python    
    # Resource utilization metrics
    cpu_usage: Gauge = field(default_factory=lambda: Gauge(
        'data_service_cpu_usage_percent',
        'CPU usage percentage for data services',
        ['service_name', 'container_id']
    ))
    
    memory_usage: Gauge = field(default_factory=lambda: Gauge(
        'data_service_memory_usage_bytes',
        'Memory usage in bytes for data services',
        ['service_name', 'container_id']
    ))
```
Resource utilization metrics track CPU and memory usage for capacity management and auto-scaling decisions. Per-container tracking enables detailed resource analysis while percentage and byte measurements provide comprehensive resource visibility.

```python
    # Data quality metrics
    data_quality_score: Gauge = field(default_factory=lambda: Gauge(
        'data_quality_score',
        'Data quality score for processed datasets',
        ['service_name', 'dataset_id', 'quality_dimension']
    ))
    
    data_errors: Counter = field(default_factory=lambda: Counter(
        'data_processing_errors_total',
        'Total data processing errors',
        ['service_name', 'error_type', 'severity']
    ))
```
Data quality metrics ensure processing accuracy with quality scores per dataset and quality dimension. Error counting tracks processing failures with categorization by type and severity for comprehensive issue analysis.

Resource and data quality metrics provide operational insights into service health and data processing reliability. CPU and memory tracking enable capacity planning while data quality metrics ensure processing accuracy.

```python
class DataServiceMonitor:
    """Comprehensive monitoring system for production data services"""
    
    def __init__(self, monitoring_config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.config = monitoring_config
        self.metrics = DataServiceMetrics()
        self.alert_manager = AlertManager(monitoring_config.get("alerts", {}))
        
        # Service discovery and health checking
        self.monitored_services: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
        self.health_check_interval = monitoring_config.get("health_check_interval", 30)
```
DataServiceMonitor initializes comprehensive service monitoring with metrics collection and alert management. Service registry tracking and configurable health check intervals enable continuous monitoring without overwhelming data processing services.

```python
        # Performance baselines for anomaly detection
        self.performance_baselines = {}
        self.anomaly_detector = AnomalyDetector()
        
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
        # Start background monitoring tasks
        asyncio.create_task(self._health_monitoring_loop())
        asyncio.create_task(self._performance_monitoring_loop())
        asyncio.create_task(self._metrics_collection_loop())
```
Performance baseline tracking and anomaly detection enable proactive issue identification. Background monitoring tasks provide continuous service visibility while maintaining separation between health checks, performance monitoring, and metrics collection.

DataServiceMonitor initializes comprehensive service monitoring with health checking, performance baselining, and anomaly detection. Background monitoring tasks provide continuous service visibility without impacting data processing performance.

### Real-time Metrics Collection

Metrics collection system gathers comprehensive operational data from distributed data processing services:

```python
async def collect_service_metrics(self, service_name: str, service_endpoint: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Collect comprehensive metrics from data processing service"""
    
    metrics_data = {
        "service_name": service_name,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "endpoint": service_endpoint,
        "metrics": {}
    }
```
Metrics collection initialization creates structured data container with service identification and timestamp for temporal tracking. The metrics dictionary will contain categorized performance data from multiple endpoints.

```python
    try:
        # Collect application metrics from service endpoint
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            # Health check endpoint
            health_response = await self._fetch_health_metrics(session, service_endpoint)
            metrics_data["metrics"]["health"] = health_response
            
            # Performance metrics endpoint
            perf_response = await self._fetch_performance_metrics(session, service_endpoint)
            metrics_data["metrics"]["performance"] = perf_response
```
Application-level metrics collection orchestrates multiple endpoint calls for comprehensive service statistics. Health and performance endpoint calls gather operational data while HTTP session reuse optimizes connection overhead.

```python
            # Data processing metrics endpoint
            data_response = await self._fetch_data_processing_metrics(session, service_endpoint)
            metrics_data["metrics"]["data_processing"] = data_response
```
Data processing metrics capture throughput, latency, and error rates specific to data operations. These metrics provide insights into processing pipeline performance and capacity utilization.

Metrics collection orchestrates multiple endpoint calls to gather comprehensive service statistics. Health, performance, and data processing metrics provide complete operational visibility for data services.

```python            
        # Collect system-level resource metrics
        resource_metrics = await self._collect_resource_metrics(service_name)
        metrics_data["metrics"]["resources"] = resource_metrics
        
        # Update Prometheus metrics
        self._update_prometheus_metrics(service_name, metrics_data["metrics"])
        
        return metrics_data
```
System-level resource metrics complement application metrics with CPU, memory, and network utilization data. Prometheus metrics updates ensure time-series data availability for alerting and dashboards.

```python        
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Failed to collect metrics for {service_name}: {str(e)}")
        
        # Record metric collection failure
        self.metrics.data_errors.labels(
            service_name=service_name,
            error_type="metrics_collection_failed",
            severity="warning"
        ).inc()
        
        return {"error": str(e), "service_name": service_name}
```
Error handling ensures metrics collection failures don't impact monitoring system reliability. Failed collection attempts are tracked as metrics themselves while detailed error responses support troubleshooting.

Resource metrics collection and Prometheus integration provide comprehensive monitoring data. Error handling ensures metric collection failures don't impact service monitoring while failure tracking enables monitoring system debugging.

### Alert Management System

Alert management provides intelligent notification and escalation for data processing service issues:

```python
class AlertManager:
    """Intelligent alert management for data processing services"""
    
    def __init__(self, alert_config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.config = alert_config
        self.alert_rules = self._load_alert_rules(alert_config.get("rules", []))
        self.notification_channels = self._setup_notification_channels(alert_config.get("channels", []))
        
        # Alert suppression and grouping
        self.active_alerts: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
        self.alert_cooldowns = {}
        self.grouping_rules = alert_config.get("grouping_rules", {})
        
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```
AlertManager initialization configures rule-based alerting with notification channels for data processing services. Alert suppression and grouping prevent notification spam while rule-based evaluation enables flexible alerting conditions.

```python
    async def evaluate_alerts(self, service_metrics: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Evaluate alert rules against current service metrics"""
        
        service_name = service_metrics.get("service_name", "unknown")
        metrics = service_metrics.get("metrics", {})
        
        for rule_name, rule_config in self.alert_rules.items():
            try:
                alert_triggered = self._evaluate_alert_rule(rule_config, metrics)
```
Alert evaluation processes service metrics against configured rules for proactive issue detection. Rule iteration enables multiple alert conditions per service while exception handling ensures evaluation continues despite rule failures.

```python
                if alert_triggered:
                    alert_data = {
                        "rule_name": rule_name,
                        "service_name": service_name,
                        "severity": rule_config.get("severity", "warning"),
                        "message": rule_config.get("message", "Alert condition met"),
                        "timestamp": datetime.now(),
                        "metrics": metrics,
                        "threshold_details": alert_triggered
                    }
                    
                    await self._process_alert(alert_data)
```
Triggered alert processing creates comprehensive alert data with severity classification and metric context. Alert data includes threshold details and timestamps for troubleshooting while alert processing handles notification routing and suppression.

Alert evaluation processes service metrics against configured rules for data processing services. Rule evaluation and alert processing enable proactive issue detection and notification for operational teams.

```python                    
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f"Alert rule evaluation failed for {rule_name}: {str(e)}")
    
    def _evaluate_alert_rule(self, rule_config: Dict[str, Any], metrics: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Evaluate individual alert rule against metrics"""
        
        condition = rule_config.get("condition", {})
        metric_path = condition.get("metric_path", "")
        operator = condition.get("operator", ">")
        threshold = condition.get("threshold", 0)
        duration = condition.get("duration", 0)  # seconds
```
Alert rule evaluation extracts condition parameters for threshold comparison against metrics data. Configurable operators and thresholds enable flexible alerting logic while duration requirements prevent false alerts from transient spikes.

```python
        # Extract metric value from nested metrics data
        metric_value = self._extract_metric_value(metrics, metric_path)
        
        if metric_value is None:
            return None
```
Metric value extraction navigates nested metrics data structure to locate specific monitoring values. Missing metrics return None to prevent false alerts while maintaining evaluation robustness.

Alert rule evaluation extracts metric values and applies threshold comparisons for data processing services. Configurable operators and thresholds enable flexible alerting conditions while duration requirements prevent false alerts.

```python        
        # Evaluate threshold condition for data processing metrics
        condition_met = False
        if operator == ">":
            condition_met = metric_value > threshold
        elif operator == "<":
            condition_met = metric_value < threshold
        elif operator == ">=":
            condition_met = metric_value >= threshold
        elif operator == "<=":
            condition_met = metric_value <= threshold
```
Threshold evaluation supports comprehensive comparison operations for flexible alerting logic. Greater than and less than comparisons handle most alerting scenarios while inclusive comparisons enable boundary condition alerts.

```python
        elif operator == "==":
            condition_met = metric_value == threshold
        elif operator == "!=":
            condition_met = metric_value != threshold
        
        if condition_met:
            return {
                "metric_path": metric_path,
                "current_value": metric_value,
                "threshold": threshold,
                "operator": operator,
                "evaluation_time": datetime.now()
            }
        
        return None
```
Equality and inequality operators enable specific value matching for categorical metrics and error conditions. Condition results include comprehensive context for alert notifications while failed conditions return None to indicate no alerting required.

Threshold evaluation supports comprehensive comparison operations for flexible alerting logic. Condition results include detailed context for alert notifications and troubleshooting data processing issues.

### Performance Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection system identifies unusual patterns in data processing service behavior for proactive issue identification:

```python
class AnomalyDetector:
    """Machine learning-based anomaly detection for data processing services"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.baseline_windows = {}  # Store historical performance windows
        self.anomaly_thresholds = {
            "response_time_deviation": 3.0,  # Standard deviations
            "throughput_deviation": 2.5,
            "error_rate_threshold": 0.05,  # 5%
            "resource_utilization_threshold": 0.9  # 90%
        }
        
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```
AnomalyDetector initialization establishes statistical thresholds and historical data windows for performance baseline tracking. Configurable deviation thresholds enable tuning for different service characteristics and operational requirements.

```python
    def update_baseline(self, service_name: str, metrics: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Update performance baseline with new metrics data"""
        
        if service_name not in self.baseline_windows:
            self.baseline_windows[service_name] = {
                "response_times": [],
                "throughput_values": [],
                "error_rates": [],
                "resource_usage": []
            }
        
        baseline = self.baseline_windows[service_name]
```
Baseline updating initializes service-specific performance windows for new services while maintaining existing historical data. Performance categories track different operational dimensions for comprehensive anomaly detection.

```python
        # Update rolling windows (keep last 1000 data points)
        if "performance" in metrics:
            perf = metrics["performance"]
            if "avg_response_time" in perf:
                baseline["response_times"].append(perf["avg_response_time"])
                baseline["response_times"] = baseline["response_times"][-1000:]

Rolling window updates maintain fixed-size performance histories for statistical analysis. The 1000-point limit balances historical context with memory usage while recent data provides accurate performance baselines.

Anomaly detection maintains rolling performance baselines for data processing services. Historical data windows enable statistical comparison while configurable thresholds adapt to service characteristics.

```python            
            if "throughput" in perf:
                baseline["throughput_values"].append(perf["throughput"])
                baseline["throughput_values"] = baseline["throughput_values"][-1000:]
            
            if "error_rate" in perf:
                baseline["error_rates"].append(perf["error_rate"])
                baseline["error_rates"] = baseline["error_rates"][-1000:]
        
        if "resources" in metrics:
            resources = metrics["resources"]
            if "cpu_usage" in resources and "memory_usage" in resources:
                combined_usage = (resources["cpu_usage"] + resources["memory_usage"]) / 2
                baseline["resource_usage"].append(combined_usage)
                baseline["resource_usage"] = baseline["resource_usage"][-1000:]
```
Throughput, error rate, and resource utilization updates complete the performance baseline maintenance. Combined CPU and memory usage provides overall resource health indicators while rolling window limits ensure consistent memory footprint.

```python
    def detect_anomalies(self, service_name: str, current_metrics: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Detect performance anomalies in current metrics compared to baseline"""
        
        if service_name not in self.baseline_windows:
            return []  # No baseline established yet
        
        baseline = self.baseline_windows[service_name]
        anomalies = []
```
Anomaly detection compares current metrics against established baselines for data processing services. Missing baselines return empty results gracefully while established services undergo comprehensive statistical analysis.

Anomaly detection compares current metrics against established baselines for data processing services. Statistical analysis identifies performance deviations while empty baselines are handled gracefully during service initialization.

```python        
        # Check response time anomalies
        if baseline["response_times"] and len(baseline["response_times"]) >= 10:
            current_response_time = current_metrics.get("performance", {}).get("avg_response_time", 0)
            baseline_mean = statistics.mean(baseline["response_times"])
            baseline_std = statistics.stdev(baseline["response_times"])
```
Response time anomaly detection requires sufficient baseline data (minimum 10 points) for statistical analysis. Mean and standard deviation calculation from historical data enables z-score computation for deviation assessment.

```python
            if baseline_std > 0:  # Avoid division by zero
                z_score = abs(current_response_time - baseline_mean) / baseline_std
                if z_score > self.anomaly_thresholds["response_time_deviation"]:
                    anomalies.append({
                        "type": "response_time_anomaly",
                        "severity": "high" if z_score > 4.0 else "medium",
                        "current_value": current_response_time,
                        "baseline_mean": baseline_mean,
                        "z_score": z_score,
                        "description": f"Response time significantly higher than baseline"
                    })
```
Z-score calculation identifies statistically significant deviations from performance baselines. Severity classification and comprehensive anomaly details enable appropriate alerting and troubleshooting for data processing service performance issues.

Response time anomaly detection uses statistical analysis to identify performance degradation in data processing services. Z-score calculation and severity classification enable appropriate alerting and escalation.
