# Session 7 Module B - Test Solutions

## Enterprise Agent Systems - Answer Key

**Question 1:** Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategy  
A) Rolling updates with Kubernetes orchestration and canary deployment capability âœ…  
B) Single instance deployment  
C) Manual server restart  
D) Blue-green deployments with traffic switching  

**Explanation**: The enterprise system uses rolling updates with Kubernetes orchestration for zero-downtime deployments, combined with canary deployment capabilities that allow gradual traffic shifting and risk mitigation during updates.

**Question 2:** Load Balancer Traffic Routing  
A) First-available agent  
B) Health-based routing with weighted distribution and canary traffic management âœ…  
C) Random distribution  
D) Round-robin only  
**Explanation**: The load balancer implements intelligent traffic routing based on agent health status, supports weighted distribution for performance optimization, and provides canary traffic management for safe deployment rollouts.

**Question 3:** Enterprise Security Controls  
A) Role-based access control, audit logging, and compliance policy enforcement âœ…  
B) No security controls  
C) Basic authentication only  
D) Manual authorization  
**Explanation**: The SecurityManager implements comprehensive enterprise security including role-based access control for granular permissions, audit logging for compliance tracking, and automated policy enforcement for security governance.

**Question 4:** Observability System Features  
A) Manual monitoring  
B) Basic logging only  
C) Distributed tracing, structured logging, metrics collection, and SLO management âœ…  
D) Error logs only  
**Explanation**: The enterprise observability stack provides comprehensive monitoring with distributed tracing for request flow analysis, structured logging for searchable insights, metrics collection for performance tracking, and SLO management for service quality assurance.

**Question 5:** Auto-Scaling Response Mechanism  
A) Manual scaling only  
B) Fixed instance count  
C) CPU and memory-based horizontal pod autoscaling with custom metrics âœ…  
D) Manual load balancing  
**Explanation**: The auto-scaling system responds to load changes through horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU and memory utilization, enhanced with custom metrics for application-specific scaling decisions and optimal resource utilization.

### Enterprise Deployment  
- **Kubernetes orchestration** provides robust container management and scaling capabilities  
- **Rolling updates** ensure zero-downtime deployments with gradual traffic shifting  
- **Canary deployments** enable risk-free feature rollouts with traffic percentage control  

### Production Operations  
- **Health-based routing** optimizes traffic distribution based on real-time agent status  
- **Auto-scaling** maintains performance under varying load conditions  
- **Security governance** ensures compliance with enterprise security standards  

### Observability and Monitoring  
- **Distributed tracing** provides end-to-end request visibility across microservices  
- **SLO management** maintains service quality through objective measurement  
- **Structured logging** enables efficient troubleshooting and analysis
