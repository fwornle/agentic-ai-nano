A) Code complexity  
B) Performance optimization  
C) Connecting with legacy systems and ensuring security ✅  
D) User interface design  
**Correct Answer: C) Connecting with legacy systems and ensuring security**

**Explanation:** Enterprise integration primarily involves connecting with existing legacy systems while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

### Question 2
**Which pattern is most effective for ERP system integration?**

A) File-based integration  
B) Direct database access  
C) Screen scraping  
D) Adapter pattern with OAuth 2.0 authentication ✅  
**Correct Answer: D) Adapter pattern with OAuth 2.0 authentication**

**Explanation:** The adapter pattern provides a clean interface to ERP systems while OAuth 2.0 ensures secure enterprise authentication.

### Question 3
**What is the main benefit of multi-stage Docker builds for agent deployment?**

A) Better documentation  
B) Faster builds  
C) Easier debugging  
D) Reduced image size and improved security ✅  
**Correct Answer: D) Reduced image size and improved security**

**Explanation:** Multi-stage builds separate build dependencies from runtime, resulting in smaller, more secure production images.

### Question 4
**How should you handle secrets and credentials in production deployments?**

A) Environment variables  
B) Configuration files  
C) Encrypted secret management systems with rotation ✅  
D) Code comments  
**Correct Answer: C) Encrypted secret management systems with rotation**

**Explanation:** Production systems require encrypted secret management with automatic rotation and secure access controls.

### Question 5
**What is the purpose of health checks in production agent systems?**

A) Performance monitoring only  
B) Cost optimization  
C) Comprehensive system and dependency validation ✅  
D) User authentication  
**Correct Answer: C) Comprehensive system and dependency validation**

**Explanation:** Health checks validate the entire system including dependencies, ensuring the agent is ready to handle requests.

### Question 6
**Which deployment strategy minimizes downtime during updates?**

A) Maintenance windows  
B) Manual deployment  
C) All-at-once deployment  
D) Rolling updates with health checks ✅  
**Correct Answer: D) Rolling updates with health checks**

**Explanation:** Rolling updates deploy changes incrementally with health checks, ensuring zero downtime deployments.

### Question 7
**What is the most important aspect of enterprise security for agents?**

A) Firewall rules  
B) VPN access  
C) Password complexity  
D) Zero-trust architecture with encryption and audit logging ✅  
**Correct Answer: D) Zero-trust architecture with encryption and audit logging**

**Explanation:** Enterprise security requires zero-trust architecture with comprehensive encryption, audit logging, and access controls.

### Question 8
**How should you approach monitoring in enterprise agent systems?**

A) Comprehensive observability with metrics, traces, and alerts ✅  
B) Error counting  
C) Log files only  
D) Manual monitoring  
**Correct Answer: A) Comprehensive observability with metrics, traces, and alerts**

**Explanation:** Enterprise monitoring requires comprehensive observability including metrics, distributed tracing, and intelligent alerting.

### Question 9
**What makes Kubernetes suitable for enterprise agent deployment?**

A) Auto-scaling, self-healing, and enterprise orchestration ✅  
B) Simple configuration  
C) Low cost  
D) Better performance  
**Correct Answer: A) Auto-scaling, self-healing, and enterprise orchestration**

**Explanation:** Kubernetes provides auto-scaling, self-healing capabilities, and enterprise-grade orchestration features needed for production agents.

### Question 10
**Which approach is best for handling enterprise agent failures?**

A) Circuit breakers, graceful degradation, and compensation patterns ✅  
B) System shutdown  
C) Manual intervention  
D) Immediate restart  
**Correct Answer: A) Circuit breakers, graceful degradation, and compensation patterns**

**Explanation:** Enterprise failure handling requires circuit breakers, graceful degradation, and compensation patterns to maintain system reliability.
