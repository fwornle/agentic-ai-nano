# Session 0 - Module B: Test Solutions

**Multiple Choice Test - Module B Solutions**

**Question 1:** What is the key advantage of LangChain's framework approach over bare metal Python for reflection patterns?

**Answer: B) Structured prompt templating and reduced boilerplate code**

**Explanation:** LangChain provides structured components that handle prompt templating and chain orchestration, reducing boilerplate code and enabling more maintainable reflection systems. This separation of concerns makes systems easier to debug and modify.

**Question 2:** In advanced tool agents, what determines which tool is selected for a given task?

**Answer: B) Task analysis combined with historical performance data**

**Explanation:** Advanced tool agents intelligently select tools by first analyzing task requirements to extract features, then ranking candidate tools by their historical success with similar tasks, continuously improving tool selection over time.

---

**Question 3:** What are the three phases of ReAct + Reflection combination pattern?

**Answer: B) ReAct problem solving, reflection on solution quality, iterative improvement**

**Explanation:** The ReAct + Reflection combination uses a two-phase approach: first ReAct generates a solution through iterative reasoning and action, then reflection evaluates solution quality, followed by iterative improvement only if issues are identified.

---

**Question 4:** Which emerging pattern enables agents to debug and fix their own reasoning errors?

**Answer: C) Self-Debugging Pattern**

**Explanation:** The Self-Debugging Pattern enables agents to automatically detect errors in their own reasoning or execution, analyze the issues, and apply fixes. This includes validation of results, error analysis, and iterative correction attempts.

---

**Question 5:** What is the primary benefit of combining Planning with Multi-Agent Coordination?

**Answer: C) Strategic planning with coordinated execution across specialized agents**

**Explanation:** This combination tackles complex workflows that require both strategic planning and coordinated execution across multiple specialized agents, enabling sophisticated systems that can handle complex multi-phase projects with dynamic adaptation.
