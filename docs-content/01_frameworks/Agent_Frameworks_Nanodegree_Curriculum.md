# Agent Frameworks & Patterns

## 2-Week Nanodegree Module

### **Module Overview**

In an era where software systems must be intelligent, adaptive, and capable of autonomous decision-making, traditional programming approaches are reaching their limits. Data pipelines now need to handle ambiguous requirements, APIs must reason about context, and systems must adapt to changing conditions without constant human intervention. This self-paced 2-week module provides comprehensive instruction on building production-ready AI agents using 2025 state-of-the-art frameworks and implementing the five core agentic patterns: Reflection, Tool Use, ReAct, Planning, and Multi-Agent Collaboration. Through hands-on tutorials and progressive implementation, you'll master cutting-edge agent development with performance breakthroughs (CrewAI 5.76x faster execution), distributed system production capabilities, and modern protocol standardization (MCP, A2A, ACP, ANP). You'll develop skills to create intelligent, adaptable agents using both bare-metal approaches and established frameworks optimized for 2025 production environments.

## **Week 1: Core Agent Patterns & Framework Foundations**

The first week focuses on building a solid foundation in agent architecture and core patterns. You'll start by understanding the theoretical framework that underpins all modern agent systems, then dive deep into implementations that reveal how intelligent systems actually work. This progression from theory to practice ensures you can both architect new systems and debug existing ones.

### **Session 0: Introduction to Agent Frameworks & Patterns (Self-Study)**

Before jumping into code, understanding the landscape of possibilities is crucial for making informed architectural decisions. This session provides the strategic foundation that will guide your framework choices throughout your agent development career.

### **Session 1: Bare Metal Agents (Pure Python Implementation)**

Building agents from scratch isn't just an academic exercise - it's the key to understanding what happens when your production systems fail, when you need to optimize performance, or when you need to implement custom behavior that frameworks don't support. This deep dive into first principles will make you a more effective agent developer regardless of which frameworks you ultimately choose.

### **Session 6: Atomic Agents Modular Architecture**

As agent systems grow in complexity, modular design becomes crucial for maintainability and scalability. Atomic Agents represents a different architectural philosophy - instead of monolithic frameworks, it provides composable building blocks that can be combined to create exactly the system you need.

**Content:** Modular, composable agent architecture with atomic components, lightweight patterns, composable tool systems, and modular multi-agent coordination bridging individual frameworks and production patterns
