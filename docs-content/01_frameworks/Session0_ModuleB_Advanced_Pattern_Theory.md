## Part 1: Pattern Implementation Strategies (10 minutes)

### Framework-Specific Pattern Implementations

Each framework implements the core patterns differently, with trade-offs in complexity, performance, and flexibility:

#### Reflection Pattern Implementations

**Bare Metal Python Approach:**

The simplest approach implements reflection manually with basic iteration control. This gives you full control over the reflection process but requires handling all the logic yourself.

```python
class BareMetalReflectionAgent:
    def reflect_and_improve(self, initial_response: str, task: str) -> str:
        """Manual implementation of reflection loop"""
        max_iterations = 3
        current_response = initial_response
```

The core loop iterates up to a maximum number of times to prevent infinite reflection. Each iteration has three phases: critique generation, satisfaction checking, and response improvement.

```python
        for iteration in range(max_iterations):
            # Generate critique
            critique_prompt = f"""
            Task: {task}
            Response: {current_response}
            
            Critique this response for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
            Provide specific suggestions for improvement.
            """
            
            critique = self.llm.generate(critique_prompt)
```

The critique phase analyzes the current response against the original task, looking for areas of improvement. The prompt specifically asks for actionable suggestions rather than just identifying problems.

```python
            # Check if satisfactory
            if "SATISFACTORY" in critique:
                break
                
            # Generate improved response
            improvement_prompt = f"""
            Original task: {task}
            Previous response: {current_response}
            Critique: {critique}
            
            Generate an improved response addressing the critique.
            """
            
            current_response = self.llm.generate(improvement_prompt)
            
        return current_response
```

If the critique indicates satisfaction, the loop terminates early. Otherwise, an improvement prompt incorporates the critique to generate a better response, which becomes the input for the next iteration.

**LangChain Framework Approach:**

LangChain provides structured components that handle prompt templating and chain orchestration, reducing boilerplate code and enabling more maintainable reflection systems.

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

class LangChainReflectionAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Critique chain
        self.critique_chain = LLMChain(
            llm=self.llm,
            prompt=PromptTemplate(
                template="Critique this response: {response}\nFor task: {task}",
                input_variables=["response", "task"]
            )
        )
```

The critique chain is defined once with a reusable template. LangChain handles variable substitution and prompt formatting automatically, reducing errors and improving consistency.

```python
        # Improvement chain  
        self.improve_chain = LLMChain(
            llm=self.llm,
            prompt=PromptTemplate(
                template="Improve response based on critique:\nOriginal: {response}\nCritique: {critique}",
                input_variables=["response", "critique"]
            )
        )
```

The improvement chain similarly uses a template that clearly defines its inputs. This separation of concerns makes the system easier to debug and modify.

```python
    def reflect_and_improve(self, response: str, task: str) -> str:
        """Framework-assisted reflection implementation"""
        critique = self.critique_chain.run(response=response, task=task)
        improved = self.improve_chain.run(response=response, critique=critique)
        return improved
```

The main method becomes much simpler, focusing on the high-level flow rather than prompt construction details. Each chain handles its own complexity internally.

**PydanticAI Type-Safe Approach:**

PydanticAI takes a different approach by enforcing type safety and structured outputs. This prevents common errors and makes agent behavior more predictable:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Literal

class CritiqueResult(BaseModel):
    accuracy_score: float
    completeness_score: float  
    clarity_score: float
    suggestions: List[str]
    overall_rating: Literal["poor", "fair", "good", "excellent"]

class ImprovedResponse(BaseModel):
    enhanced_content: str
    improvements_made: List[str]
    confidence_level: float
```

By defining structured models for critique and improvement results, the system ensures consistent output formats. This makes it easier to build reliable downstream systems that consume agent outputs.

```python
class PydanticReflectionAgent:
    def reflect_and_improve(self, response: str, task: str) -> ImprovedResponse:
        """Type-safe reflection with structured outputs"""
        
        # Generate structured critique
        critique: CritiqueResult = self.critique_agent.run(
            f"Critique response: {response} for task: {task}"
        )
        
        # Only improve if scores are below threshold
        if critique.overall_rating in ["poor", "fair"]:
            improved: ImprovedResponse = self.improvement_agent.run(
                f"Improve: {response}\nSuggestions: {critique.suggestions}"
            )
            return improved
        
        return ImprovedResponse(
            enhanced_content=response,
            improvements_made=[],
            confidence_level=0.95
        )
```

The type-safe approach enables intelligent decision-making based on structured scores rather than string parsing. The system only attempts improvement when the critique indicates it's necessary, avoiding unnecessary LLM calls.

#### Tool Use Pattern Implementations

**Dynamic Tool Discovery:**

Advanced tool agents go beyond static tool sets by intelligently selecting and learning from tool usage. This approach combines task analysis with historical performance data.

```python
class AdvancedToolAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tool_registry = ToolRegistry()
        self.tool_performance_tracker = ToolPerformanceTracker()
```

The system maintains both a registry of available tools and a performance tracker that learns which tools work best for different types of tasks.

```python
    def select_optimal_tool(self, task_description: str) -> Tool:
        """Intelligent tool selection based on task analysis and historical performance"""
        
        # Analyze task requirements
        task_features = self.extract_task_features(task_description)
        
        # Get candidate tools
        candidate_tools = self.tool_registry.find_matching_tools(task_features)
```

Tool selection starts with understanding what the task requires, then finding tools with matching capabilities. This prevents trying inappropriate tools for the given task.

```python
        # Rank by historical performance
        ranked_tools = self.tool_performance_tracker.rank_tools(
            tools=candidate_tools,
            task_features=task_features
        )
        
        return ranked_tools[0] if ranked_tools else None
```

Rather than random selection, the system ranks candidate tools by their historical success with similar tasks, continuously improving tool selection over time.

```python
    def execute_with_fallback(self, tool: Tool, params: dict) -> dict:
        """Execute tool with automatic fallback to alternatives"""
        try:
            result = tool.execute(params)
            self.tool_performance_tracker.record_success(tool, params, result)
            return result
```

Successful tool executions are recorded to improve future selection. The system learns which tools work reliably for which types of parameters.

```python
        except ToolExecutionError as e:
            # Try fallback tools
            fallback_tools = self.tool_registry.get_fallback_tools(tool)
            for fallback in fallback_tools:
                try:
                    result = fallback.execute(params)
                    self.tool_performance_tracker.record_fallback_success(fallback, params, result)
                    return result
                except ToolExecutionError:
                    continue
            
            # All tools failed
            self.tool_performance_tracker.record_failure(tool, params, e)
            raise e
```

When tools fail, the system automatically tries fallback alternatives. Both failures and successful fallbacks are tracked to improve the robustness of future tool selection.

## Part 2: Pattern Combinations (8 minutes)

### Sophisticated Pattern Orchestration

Real-world agents combine multiple patterns for sophisticated behaviors:

#### ReAct + Reflection Combination

Combining patterns creates sophisticated capabilities that exceed what each pattern can achieve individually. This example shows ReAct reasoning enhanced with quality assurance through reflection.

```python
class ReActReflectionAgent:
    """Combines ReAct reasoning with reflection for robust problem solving"""
    
    def solve_complex_problem(self, problem: str) -> dict:
        """Multi-pattern problem solving with quality assurance"""
        
        # Phase 1: ReAct problem solving
        react_solution = self.react_solve(problem)
        
        # Phase 2: Reflection on solution quality
        solution_critique = self.reflect_on_solution(react_solution, problem)
```

The two-phase approach first uses ReAct to generate a solution through iterative reasoning and action, then applies reflection to evaluate the quality of that solution.

```python
        # Phase 3: Iterative improvement
        if solution_critique.needs_improvement:
            improved_solution = self.improve_solution(
                original=react_solution,
                critique=solution_critique,
                problem=problem
            )
            return improved_solution
        
        return react_solution
```

Only if reflection identifies issues does the system engage in improvement. This prevents unnecessary refinement when the initial solution is already adequate.

```python
    def react_solve(self, problem: str) -> dict:
        """ReAct pattern: iterative reasoning and acting"""
        solution_steps = []
        current_state = {"problem": problem, "progress": []}
        
        for step in range(self.max_react_steps):
            # Think
            thought = self.generate_thought(current_state)
            
            # Act
            action = self.decide_action(thought, current_state)
            observation = self.execute_action(action)
```

The ReAct implementation follows the classic think-act-observe cycle, building understanding through interaction rather than pure reasoning.

```python
            # Update state
            current_state["progress"].append({
                "step": step,
                "thought": thought,
                "action": action,
                "observation": observation
            })
            
            # Check if problem is solved
            if self.is_problem_solved(current_state):
                break
        
        return {
            "solution": self.extract_solution(current_state),
            "reasoning_chain": current_state["progress"]
        }
```

Each step is recorded to provide transparency into the reasoning process, and the system checks for completion after each iteration to avoid unnecessary work.

#### Planning + Multi-Agent Coordination

This combination tackles complex workflows that require both strategic planning and coordinated execution across multiple specialized agents.

```python
class PlanningCoordinationAgent:
    """Combines planning with multi-agent coordination for complex workflows"""
    
    def execute_collaborative_plan(self, high_level_goal: str) -> dict:
        """Create plan and coordinate multiple agents for execution"""
        
        # Phase 1: High-level planning
        master_plan = self.create_master_plan(high_level_goal)
        
        # Phase 2: Agent assignment and task delegation
        agent_assignments = self.assign_tasks_to_agents(master_plan)
        
        # Phase 3: Coordinated execution with dynamic re-planning
        results = self.coordinate_execution(agent_assignments)
```

The three-phase approach separates strategic planning from agent assignment and execution coordination. This separation enables specialization while maintaining overall coherence.

```python
        return {
            "original_goal": high_level_goal,
            "plan": master_plan,
            "execution_results": results,
            "success_metrics": self.evaluate_success(results, high_level_goal)
        }
```

The return structure provides complete transparency into the planning and execution process, enabling post-analysis and continuous improvement of coordination strategies.

```python
    def coordinate_execution(self, assignments: List[AgentAssignment]) -> dict:
        """Dynamic coordination with replanning capability"""
        execution_results = {}
        
        for phase in self.execution_phases:
            phase_agents = [a for a in assignments if a.phase == phase]
            
            # Parallel execution within phase
            phase_results = asyncio.gather(*[
                agent.execute_assignment(assignment)
                for agent, assignment in phase_agents
            ])
```

Execution is organized by phases, with agents working in parallel within each phase. This balances efficiency (parallel work) with coordination (sequential phases).

```python
            # Check if replanning needed
            if self.requires_replanning(phase_results):
                updated_plan = self.replan_remaining_phases(
                    original_plan=self.master_plan,
                    completed_phases=[phase],
                    phase_results=phase_results
                )
                self.update_agent_assignments(updated_plan)
            
            execution_results[phase] = phase_results
        
        return execution_results
```

After each phase, the system evaluates whether the original plan is still viable. If not, it dynamically replans the remaining phases based on actual results, ensuring adaptability to changing conditions.

### Pattern Synergy Effects

## Part 3: Emerging Patterns (7 minutes)

### Next-Generation Agentic Patterns

Research and industry development are producing new patterns beyond the core five:

#### Constitutional AI Pattern

Constitutional AI ensures agents operate within defined ethical and safety boundaries. This pattern implements a two-phase approach: generation followed by constitutional checking and revision:

```python
class ConstitutionalAgent:
    """Implements constitutional AI for ethical and safe agent behavior"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.constitution = self.load_constitutional_principles()
        self.violation_detector = ConstitutionalViolationDetector()
```

The constitution defines principles the agent must follow, such as avoiding harmful content, respecting privacy, or maintaining factual accuracy. The violation detector analyzes responses for principle violations.

```python
    def constitutional_response(self, query: str) -> dict:
        """Generate response that adheres to constitutional principles"""
        
        # Generate initial response
        initial_response = self.base_agent.generate(query)
        
        # Check for constitutional violations
        violations = self.violation_detector.check_response(
            response=initial_response,
            constitution=self.constitution
        )
```

Every response is checked against the constitution. This happens after generation rather than constraining the initial generation, allowing for more natural responses that are then refined.

```python
        if violations:
            # Revise response to address violations
            revised_response = self.revise_for_constitution(
                original=initial_response,
                violations=violations,
                query=query
            )
            
            return {
                "response": revised_response,
                "constitutional_status": "revised",
                "violations_addressed": violations
            }
        
        return {
            "response": initial_response,
            "constitutional_status": "compliant",
            "violations_addressed": []
        }
```

When violations are detected, the system revises the response to comply with constitutional principles while maintaining helpfulness. The return structure provides transparency about any revisions made.

#### Self-Debugging Pattern

The Self-Debugging Pattern enables agents to identify and correct their own errors autonomously, similar to how human developers debug code:

```python
class SelfDebuggingAgent:
    """Agent that can debug and fix its own reasoning errors"""
    
    def self_debugging_execute(self, task: str) -> dict:
        """Execute task with automatic error detection and correction"""
        
        execution_trace = []
        max_debug_iterations = 3
        
        for iteration in range(max_debug_iterations):
            try:
                # Attempt task execution
                result = self.execute_task(task)
                
                # Validate result quality
                validation_result = self.validate_execution(task, result, execution_trace)
```

Each iteration attempts to execute the task and validates the result. This validation checks for logical errors, incomplete solutions, or inconsistencies that might not cause exceptions but still represent failures.

```python
                if validation_result.is_valid:
                    return {
                        "result": result,
                        "debug_iterations": iteration,
                        "execution_trace": execution_trace
                    }
                else:
                    # Debug and fix issues
                    debug_analysis = self.analyze_execution_issues(
                        task=task,
                        failed_result=result,
                        validation_issues=validation_result.issues
                    )
                    
                    # Apply fixes
                    self.apply_debugging_fixes(debug_analysis.fixes)
                    execution_trace.append(debug_analysis)
```

When validation fails, the system analyzes what went wrong and attempts to fix the issues. This is similar to how a developer would debug code by identifying the problem and applying targeted fixes.

```python
            except Exception as e:
                # Handle execution errors
                error_analysis = self.analyze_execution_error(e, task, execution_trace)
                self.apply_error_fixes(error_analysis.fixes)
                execution_trace.append(error_analysis)
        
        return {
            "result": None,
            "debug_iterations": max_debug_iterations,
            "execution_trace": execution_trace,
            "status": "failed_after_debugging"
        }
```

Exception handling addresses runtime errors through systematic analysis and fix application. If all debugging attempts fail, the system returns a detailed trace of what was attempted, enabling human developers to understand and address the underlying issues.

#### Meta-Learning Pattern

Meta-Learning enables agents to adapt their learning strategies based on the domain and task characteristics, essentially "learning how to learn":

```python
class MetaLearningAgent:
    """Agent that learns how to learn and adapt its learning strategies"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.learning_strategies = LearniningStrategyRegistry()
        self.meta_optimizer = MetaLearningOptimizer()
        
    def adaptive_learning_execution(self, new_domain_task: str) -> dict:
        """Execute task in new domain while adapting learning approach"""
        
        # Analyze domain characteristics
        domain_analysis = self.analyze_domain(new_domain_task)
        
        # Select appropriate learning strategy
        learning_strategy = self.learning_strategies.select_strategy(domain_analysis)
```

The system first analyzes the domain to understand its characteristics (e.g., mathematical, linguistic, creative) and selects an initial learning strategy optimized for that domain type.

```python
        # Execute with continuous meta-learning
        execution_results = []
        
        for attempt in range(self.max_learning_attempts):
            # Execute with current strategy
            result = self.execute_with_strategy(new_domain_task, learning_strategy)
            execution_results.append(result)
            
            # Meta-evaluate learning effectiveness
            meta_feedback = self.meta_optimizer.evaluate_learning_progress(
                results=execution_results,
                domain=domain_analysis,
                strategy=learning_strategy
            )
```

Each attempt uses the current learning strategy and evaluates not just task performance but learning effectiveness. The meta-optimizer analyzes whether the learning approach is working well for this specific domain.

```python
            # Adapt learning strategy if needed
            if meta_feedback.should_adapt:
                learning_strategy = self.meta_optimizer.adapt_strategy(
                    current_strategy=learning_strategy,
                    feedback=meta_feedback,
                    domain=domain_analysis
                )
        
        return {
            "final_result": execution_results[-1],
            "learning_progression": execution_results,
            "adapted_strategy": learning_strategy,
            "meta_insights": meta_feedback
        }
```

When the current strategy isn't effective, the meta-optimizer adapts the approach based on what has been learned about this domain. The system returns the complete learning journey, showing how the agent improved its learning approach.

#### Swarm Intelligence Pattern

Swarm Intelligence leverages collective problem-solving by coordinating multiple diverse agents, similar to how ant colonies or bee swarms solve complex problems:

```python
class SwarmIntelligenceAgent:
    """Implements swarm intelligence for collective problem solving"""
    
    def swarm_solve(self, complex_problem: str, swarm_size: int = 10) -> dict:
        """Use swarm intelligence for collaborative problem solving"""
        
        # Initialize diverse agent swarm
        swarm = self.create_diverse_swarm(swarm_size, complex_problem)
        
        # Swarm exploration phase
        exploration_results = self.swarm_exploration(swarm, complex_problem)
```

The swarm is initialized with diverse agents, each having different approaches and specializations. During exploration, agents work independently to generate different solution approaches, maximizing the solution space coverage.

```python
        # Information sharing and convergence
        shared_knowledge = self.share_swarm_knowledge(exploration_results)
        
        # Collaborative solution refinement
        refined_solutions = self.swarm_refinement(swarm, shared_knowledge)
```

After independent exploration, agents share their findings and insights. This collective knowledge enables each agent to refine their solutions based on what others have discovered, leading to superior combined solutions.

```python
        # Consensus building
        final_solution = self.build_swarm_consensus(refined_solutions)
        
        return {
            "solution": final_solution,
            "swarm_size": swarm_size,
            "exploration_diversity": self.measure_solution_diversity(exploration_results),
            "consensus_strength": self.measure_consensus_strength(refined_solutions),
            "collective_intelligence_metrics": self.calculate_swarm_metrics(swarm)
        }
```

Consensus building synthesizes the refined solutions into a final solution that benefits from collective intelligence. The return includes metrics about solution diversity and consensus strength, providing insight into the swarm's problem-solving effectiveness.
