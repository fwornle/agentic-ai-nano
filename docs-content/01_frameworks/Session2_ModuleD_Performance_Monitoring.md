# Session 2 - Module D: Performance Monitoring & Optimization

> **⚠️ ADVANCED OPTIONAL MODULE**
> Prerequisites: Complete Session 2 core content first.

At 4:32 AM on a Monday in November 2023, Netflix's data analytics infrastructure detected a subtle 0.3% degradation in query response times across their petabyte-scale data warehouse. By 6:15 AM, before human operators even arrived at work, the system had automatically rebalanced query workloads, optimized data partition strategies, and prevented what post-incident analysis revealed would have been $4.2 million in lost business intelligence capabilities over the following week. The early warning system wasn't magic - it was precision performance monitoring that treated every millisecond of data processing latency as competitive advantage.

This is the invisible war being fought by every enterprise data system: the battle against processing degradation, resource bloat, and analytical chaos. When Snowflake serves 100 million queries daily, when Databricks processes petabyte-scale machine learning workloads, or when BigQuery handles global data analytics across billions of records, they're winning because of obsessive attention to performance metrics that most data systems never even measure.

The brutal truth of production data engineering: you can't optimize what you can't observe, and you can't compete with what you can't control. Master the art of comprehensive performance monitoring and cost optimization, and you'll build data systems that don't just survive at enterprise scale - they dominate through operational excellence that competitors can't match.

## Part 1: Performance Benchmarking & Optimization for Data Systems

### Comprehensive Data Processing Performance Measurement

🗂️ **File**: `src/session2/performance_benchmarking.py` - Performance measurement and optimization for data processing

Production data processing applications require systematic performance measurement across multiple dimensions to ensure optimal analytical throughput and resource utilization. The foundation includes comprehensive imports and metrics structure:

```python
import time
import asyncio
import statistics
import psutil
import tracemalloc
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional, Callable
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
import json
import logging

@dataclass
class DataProcessingMetrics:
    """Comprehensive performance metrics for data processing systems"""

    # Query and Processing Response Time Metrics
    avg_response_time: float = 0.0
    p50_response_time: float = 0.0
    p90_response_time: float = 0.0
```

The metrics dataclass captures response time percentiles essential for understanding data processing performance under different analytical workloads and query complexities.

```python
    p95_response_time: float = 0.0
    p99_response_time: float = 0.0

    # Data Throughput Metrics
    records_per_second: float = 0.0
    concurrent_queries_handled: int = 0
    max_concurrent_capacity: int = 0

    # Resource Utilization for Data Processing
    memory_usage_mb: float = 0.0
    cpu_usage_percent: float = 0.0
    memory_peak_mb: float = 0.0

    # Data-Specific Processing Metrics
    data_transfer_rate_mbps: float = 0.0
    avg_query_complexity_score: float = 0.0
    avg_dataset_size_mb: float = 0.0
    data_processing_latency: float = 0.0
```

Resource and data-specific metrics track memory consumption, CPU usage, and data transfer rates essential for cost optimization and capacity planning in data processing environments.

```python
    # Data Quality and Validation Metrics
    data_validation_time: float = 0.0
    data_quality_score: float = 0.0
    cache_hit_rate: float = 0.0

    # Error and Reliability Metrics
    error_rate: float = 0.0
    timeout_rate: float = 0.0
    retry_rate: float = 0.0
```

Data quality and error metrics provide insights into system reliability and data processing accuracy across different analytical operations and datasets.

```python
    # Business Impact Metrics
    analytical_accuracy_score: float = 0.0
    user_satisfaction_score: float = 0.0

    # Operational Excellence Metrics
    uptime_percentage: float = 0.0
    deployment_frequency: float = 0.0

    timestamp: datetime = field(default_factory=datetime.now)
```

Business impact and operational metrics ensure the data processing system maintains high standards for analytical quality and operational excellence.

The benchmark suite orchestrates comprehensive performance testing across multiple data processing scenarios:

```python
class DataProcessingBenchmarkSuite:
    """Comprehensive performance benchmarking for data processing systems"""

    def __init__(self, data_agent_factory: Callable, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.data_agent_factory = data_agent_factory
        self.config = config
        self.performance_history: List[DataProcessingMetrics] = []
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        # Initialize monitoring for data processing
        tracemalloc.start()
```

The suite initializes with a data agent factory for creating test instances and starts memory tracing to capture detailed performance data during analytical workloads.

```python
    async def run_comprehensive_benchmark(self, test_scenarios: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Execute comprehensive performance benchmark across multiple data processing scenarios"""

        benchmark_results = {
            "benchmark_id": f"data_benchmark_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}",
            "start_time": datetime.now(),
            "config": self.config,
            "scenarios": {},
            "summary": {},
            "recommendations": []
        }

        try:
            # Run each data processing test scenario
            for scenario in test_scenarios:
                scenario_name = scenario["name"]
                self.logger.info(f"Running data processing benchmark scenario: {scenario_name}")
                scenario_results = await self._run_scenario_benchmark(scenario)
                benchmark_results["scenarios"][scenario_name] = scenario_results

```

Benchmark execution creates unique IDs for tracking and organizes results by scenario, enabling comprehensive performance analysis across different data processing use cases.

```python
            # Generate summary and recommendations for data processing optimization
            benchmark_results["summary"] = self._generate_benchmark_summary(benchmark_results["scenarios"])
            benchmark_results["recommendations"] = self._generate_optimization_recommendations(benchmark_results["summary"])

            benchmark_results["end_time"] = datetime.now()
            benchmark_results["total_duration"] = (benchmark_results["end_time"] - benchmark_results["start_time"]).total_seconds()

            return benchmark_results

        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Data processing benchmark failed: {str(e)}")
            benchmark_results["error"] = str(e)
            return benchmark_results
```

Benchmark finalization includes summary generation and optimization recommendations. Duration calculation provides total execution time while error handling ensures graceful failure recovery.

```python
    async def _run_scenario_benchmark(self, scenario: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Run performance benchmark for a specific data processing scenario with comprehensive monitoring"""

        scenario_config = {
            "name": scenario["name"],
            "description": scenario.get("description", ""),
            "concurrent_users": scenario.get("concurrent_users", 1),
            "queries_per_user": scenario.get("queries_per_user", 10),
            "test_duration_seconds": scenario.get("test_duration_seconds", 60),
            "warmup_queries": scenario.get("warmup_queries", 5),
            "test_data": scenario.get("test_data", [])
        }
```

Scenario configuration extraction normalizes benchmark parameters with sensible defaults. Each parameter controls different aspects of data processing load testing including concurrency, volume, and duration.

```python
        # Start resource monitoring with baseline measurements
        start_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024  # MB
        start_cpu = psutil.cpu_percent()
```

Baseline resource monitoring captures initial system state before load testing. Memory and CPU measurements provide reference points for resource usage analysis during data processing.

```python
        # Warmup phase to stabilize performance metrics
        await self._run_warmup_phase(scenario_config)

        # Main benchmark phase with full data processing load testing
        performance_data = await self._run_load_test(scenario_config)
```

Warmup phase eliminates cold-start effects that could skew performance measurements. Main benchmark phase executes the actual load test with concurrent users and comprehensive monitoring.

```python
        # Resource measurement after load testing
        end_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024  # MB
        end_cpu = psutil.cpu_percent()

        # Calculate comprehensive performance metrics
        metrics = self._calculate_performance_metrics(
            performance_data,
            start_memory, end_memory,
            start_cpu, end_cpu
        )
```

Post-test resource measurement captures system state changes during load testing. Metrics calculation combines timing, throughput, and resource data into comprehensive performance analysis.

```python
        return {
            "config": scenario_config,
            "metrics": metrics,
            "raw_data": performance_data,
            "resource_usage": {
                "memory_delta_mb": end_memory - start_memory,
                "cpu_usage_percent": end_cpu,
                "peak_memory_mb": max(performance_data.get("memory_samples", [start_memory]))
            }
        }
```

Structured result packaging includes configuration, computed metrics, raw performance data, and resource usage analysis for comprehensive benchmark reporting.

### Concurrent Load Testing Implementation for Data Processing

The load testing system executes comprehensive performance analysis with concurrent user simulation and real-time monitoring.

```python
    async def _run_load_test(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Execute concurrent load test with comprehensive monitoring for data processing"""

        concurrent_users = config["concurrent_users"]
        queries_per_user = config["queries_per_user"]
        test_data = config["test_data"]
```

Load test parameter extraction from configuration enables flexible test scenarios. Concurrent users control parallelism while queries per user determines total analytical workload volume.

```python
        # Prepare test data for data processing load testing
        if not test_data:
            test_data = self._generate_test_data(queries_per_user * concurrent_users)
```

Test data generation creates sufficient analytical inputs for the complete load test. Auto-generation ensures adequate test coverage when specific datasets aren't provided.

```python
        # Track all performance data during execution
        all_response_times = []
        all_data_transfer_sizes = []
        error_count = 0
        timeout_count = 0
        memory_samples = []
```

Performance tracking variables collect comprehensive metrics during load testing. Response times, data transfer sizes, errors, and memory usage provide complete performance visibility.

```python
        # Create semaphore for concurrency control
        semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(concurrent_users)
```

Semaphore implementation controls concurrent request execution to match specified user count. Proper concurrency control prevents resource exhaustion while maintaining realistic load patterns.

### Individual Query Execution and Monitoring

Each query execution includes comprehensive monitoring and error handling to capture complete data processing performance characteristics.

```python
        async def run_single_query(test_query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
            """Execute single data processing query with comprehensive monitoring"""
            async with semaphore:
                start_time = time.time()
```

Query execution begins with semaphore acquisition and timing start. Semaphore ensures concurrency limits while timing captures complete query lifecycle.

```python
                try:
                    # Create data agent instance for query processing
                    agent = self.data_agent_factory()

                    # Monitor memory before query execution
                    current_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
                    memory_samples.append(current_memory)
```

Agent instantiation and memory monitoring prepare for query execution. Memory sampling enables resource usage tracking across concurrent data processing operations.

```python
                    # Execute query with timeout protection for data processing
                    response = await asyncio.wait_for(
                        agent.arun(test_query),
                        timeout=self.config.get("request_timeout", 30)
                    )

                    end_time = time.time()
                    response_time = end_time - start_time
```

Query execution with timeout protection prevents hanging queries from skewing performance measurements. Response time calculation provides core performance metrics for data processing.

```python
                    # Extract data processing information for analytics
                    data_size = len(response) if response else 0
                    query_complexity = self._calculate_query_complexity(test_query)

                    return {
                        "success": True,
                        "response_time": response_time,
                        "data_size": data_size,
                        "query_complexity": query_complexity,
                        "response_length": len(response) if response else 0,
                        "memory_usage": current_memory
                    }
```

Successful query processing captures comprehensive metrics including timing, data transfer sizes, query complexity, and resource consumption for detailed analysis.

```python
                except asyncio.TimeoutError:
                    nonlocal timeout_count
                    timeout_count += 1
                    return {
                        "success": False,
                        "error_type": "timeout",
                        "response_time": time.time() - start_time
                    }
```

Timeout handling tracks queries that exceed time limits while capturing partial timing data. Timeout counting enables reliability analysis.

```python
                except Exception as e:
                    nonlocal error_count
                    error_count += 1
                    return {
                        "success": False,
                        "error_type": type(e).__name__,
                        "error_message": str(e),
                        "response_time": time.time() - start_time
                    }
```

General exception handling captures all other errors with detailed error information. Error categorization and timing help identify failure patterns and performance impact.

### Concurrent Execution and Result Processing

All queries execute concurrently with comprehensive result aggregation for complete performance analysis.

Now we execute all queries concurrently and process the results:

```python
        # Execute all queries concurrently with exception handling
        tasks = [run_single_query(data) for data in test_data]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

Concurrent task execution uses asyncio.gather for maximum parallelism. Exception handling ensures partial failures don't abort the entire load test.

Next, we process and aggregate the performance data from all queries:

```python
        # Process results and aggregate performance data
        successful_results = []
        for result in results:
            if isinstance(result, dict) and result.get("success"):
                successful_results.append(result)
                all_response_times.append(result["response_time"])
                all_data_transfer_sizes.append(result.get("data_size", 0))
```

Result processing filters successful queries and aggregates performance metrics. Response time and data transfer size aggregation enables statistical analysis.

Finally, we return comprehensive test results for analysis:

```python
        return {
            "response_times": all_response_times,
            "data_transfer_sizes": all_data_transfer_sizes,
            "successful_queries": len(successful_results),
            "total_queries": len(results),
            "error_count": error_count,
            "timeout_count": timeout_count,
            "memory_samples": memory_samples,
            "raw_results": successful_results
        }
```

Comprehensive result packaging includes all performance data, success/failure counts, and raw results for detailed analysis and reporting.

### Performance Metrics Calculation

Comprehensive performance metrics calculation transforms raw load test data into actionable insights and statistical analysis.

```python
    def _calculate_performance_metrics(self, performance_data: Dict[str, Any],
                                     start_memory: float, end_memory: float,
                                     start_cpu: float, end_cpu: float) -> DataProcessingMetrics:
        """Calculate comprehensive performance metrics from load test data"""

        response_times = performance_data["response_times"]
        total_queries = performance_data["total_queries"]
        successful_queries = performance_data["successful_queries"]
        data_transfer_sizes = performance_data["data_transfer_sizes"]
```

Performance data extraction prepares metrics calculation from load test results. Response times, query counts, and data transfer sizes provide comprehensive analysis foundation.

```python
        if not response_times:
            return DataProcessingMetrics()  # Return empty metrics if no successful queries
```

Empty response validation prevents calculation errors when all queries fail. Default empty metrics provide consistent interface for failed load tests.

Let's calculate performance metrics step by step. First, we analyze response time patterns:

```python
        # Response time metrics with percentile analysis
        sorted_times = sorted(response_times)
        avg_response_time = statistics.mean(response_times)
        p50 = sorted_times[len(sorted_times) // 2]
        p90 = sorted_times[int(len(sorted_times) * 0.9)]
        p95 = sorted_times[int(len(sorted_times) * 0.95)]
        p99 = sorted_times[int(len(sorted_times) * 0.99)]
```

Response time analysis includes mean and percentile calculations. Percentiles (p50, p90, p95, p99) reveal response time distribution and identify outliers.

Next, we calculate throughput metrics for capacity planning:

```python
        # Throughput metrics for data processing capacity planning
        total_test_time = max(response_times) if response_times else 1
        records_per_second = successful_queries / total_test_time
```

Throughput calculation measures system capacity under load. Records per second provides key scaling metric for capacity planning and performance optimization.

We analyze data transfer performance for network and I/O optimization:

```python
        # Data transfer metrics for network and I/O analysis
        avg_data_transfer = statistics.mean(data_transfer_sizes) if data_transfer_sizes else 0
        data_transfer_rate_mbps = (sum(data_transfer_sizes) / 1024 / 1024) / total_test_time if data_transfer_sizes else 0
```

Data transfer analysis enables network optimization and I/O bottleneck identification. Transfer rates help optimize data pipeline performance and identify bandwidth constraints.

Error metrics help assess system reliability:

```python
        # Error metrics for reliability analysis
        error_rate = (total_queries - successful_queries) / total_queries if total_queries > 0 else 0
        timeout_rate = performance_data["timeout_count"] / total_queries if total_queries > 0 else 0
```

Error rate calculation measures system reliability under load. Error and timeout rates help identify stability issues and capacity limits.

Memory analysis tracks resource utilization patterns:

```python
        # Memory metrics for resource utilization
        memory_samples = performance_data.get("memory_samples", [start_memory])
        peak_memory = max(memory_samples) if memory_samples else start_memory
        avg_memory = statistics.mean(memory_samples) if memory_samples else start_memory
```

Memory analysis tracks resource utilization during load testing. Peak and average memory usage help identify memory leaks and resource requirements.

Finally, we assemble the comprehensive performance metrics:

```python
        return DataProcessingMetrics(
            avg_response_time=avg_response_time,
            p50_response_time=p50,
            p90_response_time=p90,
            p95_response_time=p95,
            p99_response_time=p99,
            records_per_second=records_per_second,
            concurrent_queries_handled=successful_queries,
            memory_usage_mb=avg_memory,
            memory_peak_mb=peak_memory,
            cpu_usage_percent=end_cpu,
            data_transfer_rate_mbps=data_transfer_rate_mbps,
            avg_dataset_size_mb=avg_data_transfer / 1024 / 1024 if avg_data_transfer else 0,
            error_rate=error_rate * 100,  # Convert to percentage
            timeout_rate=timeout_rate * 100
        )
```

Comprehensive metrics packaging includes timing, throughput, resource usage, and reliability metrics. Structured format enables consistent analysis and reporting.

### Optimization Recommendations Generation

Intelligent recommendation system analyzes performance data to suggest specific optimization strategies for improved data processing system performance.

```python
    def _generate_optimization_recommendations(self, summary: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[str]:
        """Generate actionable optimization recommendations based on benchmark results"""

        recommendations = []
```

Recommendation system initialization prepares actionable optimization suggestions. Analysis-driven recommendations help prioritize performance improvements.

```python
        # Response time recommendations for latency optimization
        avg_response_time = summary.get("avg_response_time", 0)
        if avg_response_time > 5.0:
            recommendations.append("Query response times are high (>5s). Consider implementing result caching or optimizing data warehouse queries.")
```

Response time analysis identifies latency issues and suggests caching strategies. High response times indicate need for query optimization or caching implementation.

```python
        p95_response_time = summary.get("p95_response_time", 0)
        if p95_response_time > avg_response_time * 2:
            recommendations.append("High response time variance detected. Investigate query outliers and implement timeout handling.")
```

Variance analysis detects inconsistent performance patterns. High p95 variance suggests outlier investigation and timeout handling implementation.

```python
        # Throughput recommendations for capacity optimization
        records_per_second = summary.get("records_per_second", 0)
        if records_per_second < 10:
            recommendations.append("Low data processing throughput detected. Consider implementing connection pooling or query parallelization.")
```

Throughput analysis identifies capacity limitations and suggests scaling strategies. Low throughput indicates need for connection pooling or parallel processing.

```python
        # Error rate recommendations for reliability improvement
        error_rate = summary.get("error_rate", 0)
        if error_rate > 5.0:
            recommendations.append("High error rate (>5%). Implement better error handling and query retry mechanisms.")
```

Error rate analysis identifies reliability issues and suggests resilience improvements. High error rates indicate need for better error handling and retry mechanisms.

```python
        # Memory recommendations for resource optimization
        memory_usage = summary.get("memory_usage_mb", 0)
        if memory_usage > 1000:
            recommendations.append("High memory usage detected. Consider implementing data streaming or result set pagination.")
```

Memory usage analysis identifies resource consumption issues. High memory usage suggests need for streaming strategies or result pagination for large datasets.

```python
        # Data transfer optimization for network efficiency
        data_transfer_rate = summary.get("data_transfer_rate_mbps", 0)
        if data_transfer_rate < 10:
            recommendations.append("Low data transfer throughput. Consider optimizing serialization or using columnar data formats.")
```

Data transfer analysis identifies network efficiency opportunities. Low transfer rates suggest serialization improvements or columnar format adoption.

```python
        # CPU recommendations for compute optimization
        cpu_usage = summary.get("cpu_usage_percent", 0)
        if cpu_usage > 80:
            recommendations.append("High CPU usage detected. Consider scaling horizontally or optimizing compute-intensive operations.")
```

CPU usage analysis identifies compute bottlenecks. High CPU usage suggests horizontal scaling or compute optimization needs.

```python
        if not recommendations:
            recommendations.append("Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges. Continue monitoring for trends and implement predictive scaling.")

        return recommendations
```

Default recommendation ensures actionable feedback even for well-performing systems. Continued monitoring recommendation maintains performance awareness.

## Part 2: Continuous Monitoring Systems for Data Processing

### Production Performance Monitoring

Real-time performance monitoring provides continuous visibility into data processing performance for production systems with automated alerting and analysis.

```python
class ContinuousDataProcessingMonitor:
    """Continuous performance monitoring for production data processing systems with real-time analysis"""

    def __init__(self, monitoring_config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.config = monitoring_config
        self.metrics_buffer: List[DataProcessingMetrics] = []
        self.alert_thresholds = monitoring_config.get("alert_thresholds", {})
        self.monitoring_active = False
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Continuous monitoring initialization establishes configuration, metrics buffering, alert thresholds, and logging infrastructure for production data processing monitoring.

```python
    async def start_monitoring(self, data_agent_instance):
        """Start continuous performance monitoring with multiple concurrent tasks for data processing"""

        self.monitoring_active = True
        self.logger.info("Starting continuous data processing performance monitoring")
```

Monitoring activation begins comprehensive real-time analysis. Multiple concurrent tasks provide complete system visibility across different data processing performance dimensions.

```python
        # Start monitoring tasks for comprehensive system analysis
        monitoring_tasks = [
            asyncio.create_task(self._monitor_query_response_times(data_agent_instance)),
            asyncio.create_task(self._monitor_resource_usage()),
            asyncio.create_task(self._monitor_data_processing_errors(data_agent_instance)),
            asyncio.create_task(self._process_metrics_buffer())
        ]
```

Concurrent monitoring tasks track query response times, resource usage, error rates, and metrics processing. Parallel execution ensures comprehensive monitoring without performance impact.

```python
        try:
            await asyncio.gather(*monitoring_tasks)
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Data processing monitoring error: {str(e)}")
        finally:
            self.monitoring_active = False
```

Task coordination with exception handling ensures monitoring resilience. Cleanup ensures proper monitoring state management and resource release.

### Query Response Time Monitoring Implementation

Continuous response time monitoring uses method injection to track data processing performance without modifying agent code.

```python
    async def _monitor_query_response_times(self, data_agent_instance):
        """Monitor data processing query response times continuously with method injection"""

        while self.monitoring_active:
            try:
                # Inject monitoring into data agent calls using method wrapping
                original_run = data_agent_instance.run
```

Method injection preserves original data agent functionality while adding monitoring capabilities. Original method reference enables seamless monitoring integration.

```python
                def monitored_run(input_query):
                    start_time = time.time()
                    try:
                        result = original_run(input_query)
                        response_time = time.time() - start_time

                        # Record successful query metric
                        self._record_query_response_time_metric(response_time, True)

                        return result
```

Successful query monitoring captures timing and records metrics. Response time measurement includes complete query lifecycle for accurate performance analysis.

```python
                    except Exception as e:
                        response_time = time.time() - start_time
                        self._record_query_response_time_metric(response_time, False)
                        raise e
```

Exception handling maintains timing accuracy even for failed queries. Error metrics provide complete performance picture including failure response times.

```python
                data_agent_instance.run = monitored_run

                await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Check every second

            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f"Query response time monitoring error: {str(e)}")
                await asyncio.sleep(5)
```

Method replacement enables monitoring activation with minimal agent modification. Error handling ensures monitoring resilience with graceful degradation.

### Resource Usage Monitoring

Continuous system resource monitoring tracks memory and CPU usage with configurable alerting thresholds for proactive data processing system management.

```python
    async def _monitor_resource_usage(self):
        """Monitor system resource usage with threshold-based alerting for data processing"""

        while self.monitoring_active:
            try:
                # Get current resource usage metrics
                process = psutil.Process()
                memory_mb = process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
                cpu_percent = process.cpu_percent()
```

Resource monitoring captures real-time system utilization using psutil. Memory and CPU measurements provide essential operational visibility for capacity planning.

```python
                # Check against configurable thresholds for data processing
                if memory_mb > self.alert_thresholds.get("memory_mb", 1000):
                    await self._send_alert("HIGH_MEMORY_USAGE", f"Memory usage: {memory_mb:.1f}MB")

                if cpu_percent > self.alert_thresholds.get("cpu_percent", 80):
                    await self._send_alert("HIGH_CPU_USAGE", f"CPU usage: {cpu_percent:.1f}%")
```

Threshold-based alerting enables proactive response to resource constraints. Configurable thresholds adapt monitoring to different deployment environments and requirements.

```python
                # Record metrics for trend analysis
                self._record_resource_metric(memory_mb, cpu_percent)

                await asyncio.sleep(self.config.get("resource_check_interval", 10))

            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f"Resource monitoring error: {str(e)}")
                await asyncio.sleep(5)
```

Resource metric recording enables trend analysis and historical comparison. Configurable check intervals balance monitoring accuracy with system overhead.

### Metrics Recording and Real-time Alerting

Performance metrics recording supports both batch analysis and real-time alerting for comprehensive data processing monitoring coverage.

```python
    def _record_query_response_time_metric(self, response_time: float, success: bool):
        """Record query response time metric with real-time alerting for data processing"""

        # Add to metrics buffer for batch processing
        metric = {
            "type": "query_response_time",
            "value": response_time,
            "success": success,
            "timestamp": datetime.now()
        }

        self.metrics_buffer.append(metric)
```

Metric buffering enables batch processing for statistical analysis. Structured metric format includes timing, success status, and timestamp for comprehensive analysis.

```python
        # Check real-time alerts for immediate response
        if response_time > self.alert_thresholds.get("response_time_seconds", 10):
            asyncio.create_task(self._send_alert(
                "SLOW_QUERY",
                f"Query response time: {response_time:.2f}s"
            ))
```

Real-time alerting enables immediate response to performance degradation. Async alert dispatch prevents monitoring overhead from impacting system performance.

### Alert System Implementation

Comprehensive alert system provides structured notifications with severity classification and integration with external monitoring platforms.

```python
    async def _send_alert(self, alert_type: str, message: str):
        """Send performance alert with severity classification for data processing systems"""

        alert = {
            "type": alert_type,
            "message": message,
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "severity": self._determine_alert_severity(alert_type)
        }

        self.logger.warning(f"Data Processing Alert [{alert_type}]: {message}")
```

Alert structure includes type classification, severity levels, and timestamps for comprehensive incident tracking. Structured format enables integration with monitoring systems.

```python
        # In production: send to monitoring system (Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)
        await self._dispatch_alert_to_monitoring_system(alert)
```

External alert dispatch enables integration with enterprise monitoring platforms. Async dispatch prevents alert processing from blocking system performance.

### Real-time Metrics Access

Real-time metrics provide immediate visibility into current data processing system performance for operational dashboards and monitoring interfaces.

```python
    def get_real_time_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get current real-time performance metrics for data processing dashboards"""

        if not self.metrics_buffer:
            return {"status": "no_data"}
```

Metrics availability check prevents empty data responses. No-data status enables graceful handling of monitoring startup periods.

```python
        # Calculate metrics from recent buffer (last 5 minutes)
        recent_metrics = [m for m in self.metrics_buffer if
                         (datetime.now() - m["timestamp"]).total_seconds() < 300]

        if not recent_metrics:
            return {"status": "no_recent_data"}
```

Recent metrics filtering provides relevant performance data for current system state. Five-minute window balances real-time accuracy with statistical significance.

```python
        response_times = [m["value"] for m in recent_metrics if m["type"] == "query_response_time"]

        if response_times:
            return {
                "avg_response_time": statistics.mean(response_times),
                "max_response_time": max(response_times),
                "min_response_time": min(response_times),
                "total_queries": len(response_times),
                "success_rate": sum(1 for m in recent_metrics if m.get("success")) / len(recent_metrics) * 100,
                "timestamp": datetime.now()
            }

        return {"status": "no_response_data"}
```

Comprehensive metrics calculation provides statistical summary of recent performance. Average, max, min response times, query counts, and success rates give complete operational visibility.

## Part 3: Advanced Monitoring & Observability for Data Systems

### Comprehensive Data Processing Monitoring Architecture

🗂️ **File**: `src/session2/monitoring_observability.py` - Production monitoring systems for data processing

Production monitoring architecture integrates Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, and structured logging for comprehensive observability across data processing systems.

```python
import prometheus_client
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge, Summary
import structlog
from opentelemetry import trace, metrics
from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.thrift import JaegerExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional
import json
from datetime import datetime
import asyncio
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import threading
```

Enterprise monitoring imports provide comprehensive observability tools. Prometheus for metrics, OpenTelemetry for tracing, and structured logging enable complete system visibility.

### Prometheus Metrics Implementation for Data Processing

Prometheus metrics provide time-series data collection for operational monitoring and alerting in production data processing applications.

```python
class DataProcessingPrometheusMetrics:
    """Prometheus metrics for data processing applications with comprehensive coverage"""

    def __init__(self, service_name: str):
        self.service_name = service_name
```

Metrics initialization establishes service identification for multi-service monitoring environments. Service name enables proper metric attribution and aggregation.

```python
        # Query and request metrics for operational monitoring
        self.request_count = Counter(
            'data_processing_queries_total',
            'Total number of queries to data processing systems',
            ['service_type', 'query_type', 'status']
        )

        self.request_duration = Histogram(
            'data_processing_query_duration_seconds',
            'Time spent processing data queries',
            ['service_type', 'operation'],
            buckets=[0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 30.0, 60.0, 300.0]
        )
```

Query metrics track volume and timing for capacity planning. Counter tracks total queries by type and status while histogram captures latency distribution with appropriate buckets for data processing operations.

```python
        # Data processing specific metrics for analytics and cost optimization
        self.data_records_processed = Counter(
            'data_processing_records_total',
            'Total data records processed',
            ['service_name', 'dataset_type', 'processing_stage']
        )

        self.data_processing_latency = Histogram(
            'data_processing_operation_latency_seconds',
            'Data processing operation latency by type',
            ['service_name', 'operation_type'],
            buckets=[0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 60.0]
        )
```

Data processing metrics enable cost optimization and performance analysis. Record tracking supports throughput monitoring while latency metrics monitor processing efficiency across different data operations.

```python
        self.data_transfer_bytes = Counter(
            'data_processing_transfer_bytes_total',
            'Total bytes transferred during data processing',
            ['service_name', 'direction', 'data_source']
        )

        # Resource utilization metrics for capacity planning
        self.cpu_usage = Gauge(
            'data_processing_cpu_usage_percent',
            'CPU usage percentage for data processing services',
            ['service_name', 'container_id']
        )

        self.memory_usage = Gauge(
            'data_processing_memory_usage_bytes',
            'Memory usage in bytes for data processing services',
            ['service_name', 'container_id']
        )
```

Data transfer and resource metrics track bandwidth utilization and system capacity. Transfer metrics enable network optimization while resource gauges support capacity planning and auto-scaling decisions.

```python
        # Data quality and reliability metrics
        self.data_quality_score = Gauge(
            'data_quality_score',
            'Data quality score for processed datasets',
            ['service_name', 'dataset_id', 'quality_dimension']
        )

        self.processing_errors = Counter(
            'data_processing_errors_total',
            'Total data processing errors by type',
            ['service_name', 'error_type', 'severity', 'dataset_type']
        )
```

Quality and error metrics provide operational insights into data processing reliability and accuracy. Quality scores track data integrity while error categorization enables targeted improvements.

### Metrics Recording Methods for Data Processing

Dedicated recording methods provide convenient interfaces for capturing different types of performance data throughout the data processing application lifecycle.

```python
    def record_query(self, service_type: str, query_type: str, status: str, duration: float, operation: str = "query"):
        """Record data processing query metrics with type and operation context"""
        self.request_count.labels(service_type=service_type, query_type=query_type, status=status).inc()
        self.request_duration.labels(service_type=service_type, operation=operation).observe(duration)
```

Query recording captures both volume and timing metrics. Labels enable filtering and aggregation by service type, query type, and status for detailed analysis.

```python
    def record_data_processing(self, service_name: str, dataset_type: str, processing_stage: str,
                              records_processed: int, operation_latency: float, operation_type: str):
        """Record comprehensive data processing metrics for analytics and optimization"""
        self.data_records_processed.labels(
            service_name=service_name,
            dataset_type=dataset_type,
            processing_stage=processing_stage
        ).inc(records_processed)

        self.data_processing_latency.labels(
            service_name=service_name,
            operation_type=operation_type
        ).observe(operation_latency)
```

Data processing recording captures comprehensive metrics for optimization. Record counts and latency tracking enable detailed analysis of processing patterns and performance bottlenecks.

```python
    def record_data_transfer(self, service_name: str, direction: str, data_source: str, bytes_transferred: int):
        """Record data transfer metrics for bandwidth and cost analysis"""
        self.data_transfer_bytes.labels(
            service_name=service_name,
            direction=direction,
            data_source=data_source
        ).inc(bytes_transferred)

    def record_error(self, service_name: str, error_type: str, severity: str, dataset_type: str):
        """Record data processing error metrics for reliability monitoring"""
        self.processing_errors.labels(
            service_name=service_name,
            error_type=error_type,
            severity=severity,
            dataset_type=dataset_type
        ).inc()
```

Transfer and error metrics enable operational optimization. Data transfer tracking supports cost analysis while error categorization enables targeted reliability improvements.

### Structured Logging Implementation for Data Processing

Structured logging provides machine-readable log format with consistent metadata for comprehensive data processing application observability and troubleshooting.

```python
class DataProcessingStructuredLogging:
    """Structured logging for data processing applications with comprehensive context"""

    def __init__(self, service_name: str, log_level: str = "INFO"):
        self.service_name = service_name
```

Structured logging initialization establishes service context and configuration. Service name provides consistent identification across distributed data processing systems.

```python
        # Configure structured logging with processors for data processing
        structlog.configure(
            processors=[
                structlog.stdlib.filter_by_level,
                structlog.stdlib.add_logger_name,
                structlog.stdlib.add_log_level,
                structlog.stdlib.PositionalArgumentsFormatter(),
                structlog.processors.TimeStamper(fmt="iso"),
```

Processor configuration creates consistent log structure. Level filtering, logger names, timestamps, and formatting enable structured analysis and aggregation.

```python
                structlog.processors.StackInfoRenderer(),
                structlog.processors.format_exc_info,
                structlog.processors.UnicodeDecoder(),
                structlog.processors.JSONRenderer()
            ],
            context_class=dict,
            logger_factory=structlog.stdlib.LoggerFactory(),
            wrapper_class=structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger,
            cache_logger_on_first_use=True,
        )

        self.logger = structlog.get_logger(service_name)
```

Advanced processors handle stack traces, exception formatting, unicode encoding, and JSON rendering. Factory and wrapper configuration integrates with standard Python logging.

### Specialized Data Processing Logging Methods

Specialized logging methods capture different types of events with appropriate structured context for comprehensive traceability in data processing systems.

```python
    def log_query_execution(self, query_id: str, dataset_type: str, query_text: str,
                           result_size: int, duration: float, status: str, **kwargs):
        """Log data processing query execution with comprehensive structured context"""

        self.logger.info(
            "data_query_executed",
            query_id=query_id,
            dataset_type=dataset_type,
            query_length=len(query_text),
            result_size=result_size,
            duration_seconds=duration,
            status=status,
            service=self.service_name,
            **kwargs
        )
```

Query logging captures complete query lifecycle with structured metadata. Query ID enables tracing while metrics provide performance context.

```python
    def log_data_processing_operation(self, operation_id: str, operation_type: str, dataset_id: str,
                                    records_processed: int, processing_time: float,
                                    data_quality_score: float, **kwargs):
        """Log data processing operations with quality and performance context"""

        self.logger.info(
            "data_processing_operation",
            operation_id=operation_id,
            operation_type=operation_type,
            dataset_id=dataset_id,
            records_processed=records_processed,
            processing_time_seconds=processing_time,
            data_quality_score=data_quality_score,
            throughput_records_per_second=records_processed / processing_time if processing_time > 0 else 0,
            service=self.service_name,
            **kwargs
        )
```

Processing operation logging includes quality metrics and performance data. Throughput calculation and quality scoring enable comprehensive operational analysis.

### Data Quality and Error Logging

Data quality logging captures comprehensive validation and error information essential for maintaining data processing reliability and accuracy.

```python
    def log_data_quality_check(self, dataset_id: str, quality_checks: List[str],
                              quality_results: Dict[str, Any], overall_score: float, **kwargs):
        """Log data quality assessment with detailed results"""

        self.logger.info(
            "data_quality_assessment",
            dataset_id=dataset_id,
            quality_checks=quality_checks,
            quality_results=quality_results,
            overall_quality_score=overall_score,
            checks_passed=sum(1 for result in quality_results.values() if result.get("passed", False)),
            total_checks=len(quality_checks),
            service=self.service_name,
            **kwargs
        )
```

Quality check logging provides detailed assessment results and scoring. Check pass rates and overall scores enable quality trend analysis.

```python
    def log_processing_error(self, error_id: str, error_type: str, error_message: str,
                            dataset_id: str, operation_context: Dict[str, Any],
                            stack_trace: str = None, **kwargs):
        """Log data processing errors with comprehensive context"""

        self.logger.error(
            "data_processing_error",
            error_id=error_id,
            error_type=error_type,
            error_message=error_message,
            dataset_id=dataset_id,
            operation_context=operation_context,
            stack_trace=stack_trace,
            service=self.service_name,
            **kwargs
        )
```

Error logging provides structured error tracking with comprehensive context. Operation context and stack traces enable rapid debugging and issue resolution.

### Performance Alert and Cost Monitoring

Performance alert logging enables proactive monitoring by capturing threshold violations and performance degradations in data processing operations.

```python
    def log_performance_alert(self, alert_type: str, metric_name: str,
                            current_value: float, threshold: float,
                            dataset_context: Dict[str, Any] = None, **kwargs):
        """Log performance alert with data processing context"""

        self.logger.warning(
            "data_processing_performance_alert",
            alert_type=alert_type,
            metric_name=metric_name,
            current_value=current_value,
            threshold=threshold,
            threshold_exceeded_by=current_value - threshold,
            dataset_context=dataset_context or {},
            service=self.service_name,
            **kwargs
        )
```

Performance alert logging includes threshold comparisons and dataset context. Exceeded amounts and context enable targeted performance optimization.

## Part 4: Cost Optimization & Resource Management for Data Processing

### Intelligent Cost Management for Data Systems

🗂️ **File**: `src/session2/cost_optimization.py` - Cost optimization strategies for data processing

Cost optimization requires comprehensive tracking and intelligent management of data processing and infrastructure costs. This system provides real-time cost monitoring, budget management, and optimization recommendations.

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import asyncio
import json
```

### Cost Metrics Data Structure for Data Processing

Cost metrics capture comprehensive cost data across multiple dimensions including compute usage, data transfer, storage consumption, and optimization savings for data processing systems.

```python
@dataclass
class DataProcessingCostMetrics:
    """Cost tracking metrics for data processing applications"""

    # Compute costs for data processing
    total_compute_hours: float = 0.0
    total_compute_cost: float = 0.0

    # Data transfer and storage costs
    total_data_transfer_gb: float = 0.0
    total_data_transfer_cost: float = 0.0
    total_storage_gb: float = 0.0
    total_storage_cost: float = 0.0

    # Query and processing costs
    total_queries_executed: int = 0
    total_query_cost: float = 0.0
```

DataProcessingCostMetrics captures compute, storage, and query costs essential for comprehensive expense tracking. Cost breakdown enables detailed analysis and optimization targeting.

```python
    # Time period for cost tracking
    period_start: datetime = None
    period_end: datetime = None

    # Cost breakdown by data processing service
    cost_by_service: Dict[str, float] = None

    # Optimization and efficiency metrics
    cache_savings: float = 0.0
    optimization_savings: float = 0.0
    efficiency_score: float = 0.0
```

### Data Processing Cost Optimization Manager

The cost optimization manager provides intelligent cost tracking, budget management, and optimization recommendations for data processing systems.

```python
class DataProcessingCostOptimizer:
    """Intelligent cost optimization for data processing applications"""

    def __init__(self, cost_config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.cost_config = cost_config
        self.cost_tracking = {}
        self.optimization_rules = []
        self.cost_alerts = []

        # Initialize cost rates for data processing services
        self.compute_costs = cost_config.get("compute_costs", {
            "data_warehouse": {"cpu_hour": 0.50, "memory_gb_hour": 0.10},
            "stream_processing": {"cpu_hour": 0.30, "memory_gb_hour": 0.08},
            "batch_processing": {"cpu_hour": 0.25, "memory_gb_hour": 0.06}
        })

        self.data_costs = cost_config.get("data_costs", {
            "storage_gb_month": 0.023,
            "data_transfer_gb": 0.09,
            "query_per_gb": 0.005
        })

        self.daily_budget = cost_config.get("daily_budget", 500.0)
        self.monthly_budget = cost_config.get("monthly_budget", 15000.0)
```

Cost optimization manager initialization with data processing specific cost structures. Compute, storage, and data transfer rates enable accurate cost tracking and budgeting.

### Data Processing Cost Tracking and Budget Management

Data processing cost tracking provides real-time cost calculation and budget monitoring with detailed service-level cost breakdown.

```python
    def track_data_processing_cost(self, service_type: str, compute_hours: float,
                                 memory_gb_hours: float, data_processed_gb: float,
                                 queries_executed: int = 0) -> float:
        """Track comprehensive data processing costs"""

        if service_type not in self.compute_costs:
            service_type = "batch_processing"  # Default fallback

        rates = self.compute_costs[service_type]
        compute_cost = compute_hours * rates["cpu_hour"]
        memory_cost = memory_gb_hours * rates["memory_gb_hour"]
        query_cost = queries_executed * self.data_costs["query_per_gb"] * data_processed_gb
        total_cost = compute_cost + memory_cost + query_cost
```

Comprehensive cost calculation includes compute, memory, and query processing costs. Service-specific rates enable accurate cost attribution and optimization targeting.

```python
        # Track costs in daily/monthly buckets
        today = datetime.now().date()
        if today not in self.cost_tracking:
            self.cost_tracking[today] = DataProcessingCostMetrics(
                period_start=datetime.combine(today, datetime.min.time()),
                cost_by_service={}
            )

        daily_metrics = self.cost_tracking[today]
        daily_metrics.total_compute_hours += compute_hours
        daily_metrics.total_compute_cost += compute_cost + memory_cost
        daily_metrics.total_queries_executed += queries_executed
        daily_metrics.total_query_cost += query_cost
```
Daily cost tracking initialization creates metrics containers for each day with service-specific breakdown. Compute hours, costs, and query tracking enable detailed expense analysis and trend monitoring.

```python
        # Track by service type
        if service_type not in daily_metrics.cost_by_service:
            daily_metrics.cost_by_service[service_type] = 0.0
        daily_metrics.cost_by_service[service_type] += total_cost

        # Check budget alerts for data processing costs
        self._check_budget_alerts(daily_metrics, total_cost)

        return total_cost
```
Service-specific cost tracking enables targeted optimization while budget alert checking provides proactive cost management. Total cost return enables immediate cost visibility for operational decisions.

Daily cost tracking organizes expenses by date and service for budget management and trend analysis. Service-specific cost breakdown enables optimization decisions.

### Budget Alert System for Data Processing

Budget alert checking monitors daily and monthly spending against configured thresholds with data processing context.

```python
    def _check_budget_alerts(self, daily_metrics: DataProcessingCostMetrics, new_cost: float):
        """Check if data processing budget thresholds are exceeded"""

        daily_total = daily_metrics.total_compute_cost + daily_metrics.total_query_cost

        # Daily budget alerts for data processing
        if daily_total > self.daily_budget * 0.8:  # 80% threshold
            self._create_budget_alert("DAILY_BUDGET_WARNING", daily_total, self.daily_budget)

        if daily_total > self.daily_budget:
            self._create_budget_alert("DAILY_BUDGET_EXCEEDED", daily_total, self.daily_budget)
```

Daily budget monitoring with early warning thresholds enables proactive cost management. Separate tracking for compute and query costs provides detailed cost visibility.

```python
        # Monthly budget calculation for data processing
        month_start = datetime.now().replace(day=1).date()
        monthly_total = sum(
            (metrics.total_compute_cost + metrics.total_query_cost)
            for date, metrics in self.cost_tracking.items()
            if date >= month_start
        )

        if monthly_total > self.monthly_budget * 0.8:
            self._create_budget_alert("MONTHLY_BUDGET_WARNING", monthly_total, self.monthly_budget)
```

Monthly budget tracking aggregates costs across the current month and compares against monthly limits for comprehensive budget management.

### Intelligent Service Selection for Cost Optimization

Service selection optimization chooses the most cost-effective data processing approach that meets performance and quality requirements.

```python
    def optimize_service_selection(self, workload_type: str, data_size_gb: float,
                                 required_latency_seconds: float) -> str:
        """Suggest optimal data processing service based on workload requirements and cost"""

        service_capabilities = {
            "data_warehouse": {"latency": 2.0, "cost_per_gb": 0.015, "max_throughput_gb_hour": 1000},
            "stream_processing": {"latency": 0.1, "cost_per_gb": 0.025, "max_throughput_gb_hour": 500},
            "batch_processing": {"latency": 30.0, "cost_per_gb": 0.008, "max_throughput_gb_hour": 2000}
        }

        # Filter services that meet latency requirements
        suitable_services = {
            service: specs for service, specs in service_capabilities.items()
            if specs["latency"] <= required_latency_seconds
        }

        if not suitable_services:
            return "data_warehouse"  # Fallback to most capable service
```

Service selection considers latency requirements, cost efficiency, and throughput capabilities. Requirement filtering ensures only suitable services are considered for optimization.

```python
        # Workload-based scoring for data processing optimization
        workload_weights = {
            "analytics": {"cost": 0.6, "latency": 0.2, "throughput": 0.2},
            "real_time": {"cost": 0.2, "latency": 0.7, "throughput": 0.1},
            "batch": {"cost": 0.8, "latency": 0.1, "throughput": 0.1}
        }

        weights = workload_weights.get(workload_type, workload_weights["analytics"])
```

Workload-specific weighting adapts optimization priorities. Analytics workloads prioritize cost while real-time workloads emphasize latency performance.

```python
        # Calculate weighted scores for cost optimization
        best_service = None
        best_score = -1

        for service, specs in suitable_services.items():
            # Normalize metrics for fair comparison
            cost_score = 1 - (specs["cost_per_gb"] / max(s["cost_per_gb"] for s in suitable_services.values()))
            latency_score = 1 - (specs["latency"] / max(s["latency"] for s in suitable_services.values()))
            throughput_score = specs["max_throughput_gb_hour"] / max(s["max_throughput_gb_hour"] for s in suitable_services.values())
```
Service scoring evaluation normalizes metrics for fair comparison across different service capabilities. Cost and latency scores are inverted (lower values get higher scores) while throughput scores favor higher values.

```python
            total_score = (
                cost_score * weights["cost"] +
                latency_score * weights["latency"] +
                throughput_score * weights["throughput"]
            )

            if total_score > best_score:
                best_score = total_score
                best_service = service

        return best_service or "batch_processing"
```
Weighted scoring combines normalized metrics using workload-specific priorities for optimal service selection. Best service tracking ensures consistent optimization decisions with fallback to batch processing for reliability.
```

Weighted scoring combines normalized cost, latency, and throughput metrics for optimal service selection. Score-based ranking ensures consistent optimization decisions.

### Cost Optimization Recommendations for Data Processing

Recommendation generation analyzes cost patterns and suggests specific optimization strategies for data processing systems.

```python
    def get_cost_optimization_recommendations(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Generate cost optimization recommendations for data processing systems"""

        recommendations = []

        # Analyze recent cost patterns
        recent_costs = self._get_recent_cost_analysis()
```

Recommendation system analyzes historical cost patterns to identify optimization opportunities specific to data processing workloads.

```python
        # High-cost service recommendations for data processing
        if recent_costs.get("data_warehouse_percentage", 0) > 70:
            recommendations.append({
                "type": "service_optimization",
                "priority": "high",
                "title": "Optimize Data Warehouse Usage",
                "description": "Consider batch processing for non-time-sensitive analytics workloads",
                "potential_savings": recent_costs.get("data_warehouse_cost", 0) * 0.4,
                "implementation": "Implement workload classification and service routing"
            })
```

Service optimization recommendations identify opportunities to use more cost-effective processing approaches. High warehouse usage triggers suggestions for batch processing alternatives.

```python
        # Data transfer optimization recommendations
        data_transfer_cost = recent_costs.get("data_transfer_cost", 0)
        if data_transfer_cost > recent_costs.get("daily_cost", 0) * 0.3:
            recommendations.append({
                "type": "data_transfer_optimization",
                "priority": "medium",
                "title": "Reduce Data Transfer Costs",
                "description": "Implement data locality strategies and result caching",
                "potential_savings": data_transfer_cost * 0.25,
                "implementation": "Add regional data caching and optimize query result sizes"
            })
```

Data transfer optimization addresses network costs through locality strategies and caching. High transfer costs trigger recommendations for regional optimization.

```python
        # Query optimization recommendations for cost efficiency
        avg_query_cost = recent_costs.get("avg_query_cost", 0)
        if avg_query_cost > 0.5:  # High per-query cost
            recommendations.append({
                "type": "query_optimization",
                "priority": "high",
                "title": "Optimize Query Efficiency",
                "description": "Implement query result caching and optimize data scanning",
                "potential_savings": recent_costs.get("query_cost", 0) * 0.3,
                "implementation": "Add intelligent caching and query optimization engine"
            })

        return recommendations
```

Query optimization recommendations focus on reducing per-query costs through caching and scanning optimization. High query costs trigger efficiency improvement suggestions.
