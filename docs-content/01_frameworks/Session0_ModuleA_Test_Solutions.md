# Session 0: Module A Historical Context & Evolution - Test Solutions

## üìù Multiple Choice Test

**Question 1:** What was the primary limitation of early AI systems that drove the development of agentic architectures?  
A) Expensive API costs  
B) Limited computational power  
C) Stateless, single-turn interaction model ‚úÖ  
D) Lack of training data

**Explanation:** Early AI systems were fundamentally limited by their inability to maintain context across interactions, use tools, or perform multi-step reasoning. This stateless nature meant each query was treated independently without memory or iterative capability, making them unsuitable for complex tasks requiring persistence or tool integration.

**Question 2:** Which research paper introduced the concept of interleaving thought and action in AI agents?  
A) Constitutional AI (2022)  
B) Reflexion (2023)  
C) ReAct (2022) ‚úÖ  
D) Toolformer (2023)

**Explanation:** The ReAct paper "Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models" introduced the groundbreaking concept of interleaving reasoning (thinking) with acting (tool use), laying the foundation for modern agentic systems. This approach enables agents to reason about when to use tools and reflect on the results.

**Question 3:** What are the three types of memory in modern agent semantic memory systems?  
A) Short-term, long-term, cache  
B) Local, distributed, cloud  
C) Input, output, processing  
D) Episodic, semantic, working ‚úÖ

**Explanation:** Modern agent memory systems implement three distinct types: episodic memory (conversation history and experiences), semantic memory (learned concepts and knowledge), and working memory (current task context and active information). This architecture enables agents to learn from experience and apply knowledge contextually.

**Question 4:** When did OpenAI launch ChatGPT Plugins, marking the first mainstream tool-augmented conversational AI?  
A) January 2023  
B) June 2023  
C) March 2023 ‚úÖ  
D) December 2022

**Explanation:** OpenAI launched ChatGPT Plugins in March 2023, representing the first mainstream deployment of tool-augmented conversational AI and demonstrating commercial viability of agent-like systems. This milestone marked the transition from research concepts to production-ready agent systems.

---

**Question 5:** According to current industry adoption patterns, what percentage of enterprise customer service uses agentic systems?  
A) 50%  
B) 40% ‚úÖ  
C) 30%  
D) 20%

**Explanation:** As of 2024-2025, approximately 40% of enterprise customer service operations have adopted agentic systems, representing significant industry adoption of agent technologies. This adoption rate reflects the proven value of agents in handling complex customer interactions and reducing operational costs.
