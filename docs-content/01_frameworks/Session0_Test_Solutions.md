# Session 0: Introduction to Agent Frameworks & Patterns - Test Solutions

**Question 1:** Which agentic pattern involves an agent evaluating and improving its own outputs?  
A) Multi-Agent  
B) Planning  
C) Tool Use  
D) Reflection âœ…  

**Explanation:** The reflection pattern specifically involves agents evaluating and improving their own outputs through iterative self-assessment. This pattern includes generating initial output, reflecting on quality, and refining based on critique.

**Question 2:** The ReAct pattern combines which two key capabilities?  
A) Reflecting and Acting  
B) Reading and Acting  
C) Retrieving and Acting  
D) Reasoning and Acting âœ…  

**Explanation:** ReAct stands for Reasoning and Acting, combining these capabilities in iterative loops. The agent reasons about what to do next, takes action, observes results, and continues the reasoning-action cycle.

**Question 3:** Which framework is best suited for high-performance applications with minimal resource usage?  
A) PydanticAI  
B) LangChain  
C) Agno âœ…  
D) CrewAI  

**Explanation:** Agno is optimized for performance with claims of 50x more memory efficiency and 10,000x faster agent instantiation, making it ideal for high-performance applications.

**Question 4:** What is the primary advantage of the Multi-Agent pattern?  
A) Lower resource usage  
B) Reduced complexity  
C) Specialized expertise collaboration âœ…  
D) Faster execution  

**Explanation:** Multi-Agent patterns allow different agents with specialized skills to collaborate on complex problems, leveraging the expertise of each agent for optimal results.

**Question 5:** Which framework emphasizes type safety through schema validation?  
A) PydanticAI âœ…  
B) CrewAI  
C) LangChain  
D) Agno  

**Explanation:** PydanticAI is built around Pydantic models for strong type safety and schema validation, ensuring data integrity throughout the agent system.

**Question 6:** The Planning pattern is most useful for:  
A) Simple query-response interactions  
B) Real-time data processing  
C) Static content generation  
D) Complex multi-step workflows âœ…  

**Explanation:** Planning patterns excel at breaking down complex tasks into manageable, sequenced subtasks, making them ideal for complex multi-step workflows.

**Question 7:** In the Tool Use pattern, what determines which tool an agent selects?  
A) Random selection  
B) Execution speed  
C) Task requirements and tool descriptions âœ…  
D) Tool availability  

**Explanation:** Agents analyze task needs against available tool capabilities and descriptions to make intelligent selection decisions about which tools to use.

**Question 8:** Which framework uses a graph-based architecture for precise control flow?  
A) PydanticAI  
B) CrewAI  
C) LangGraph âœ…  
D) Agno  

**Explanation:** LangGraph extends LangChain with graph-based architecture using nodes and edges for precise control flow, allowing complex agent workflows.

**Question 9:** The primary benefit of using agent frameworks over bare metal implementation is:  
A) Pre-built components and patterns âœ…  
B) Simpler deployment  
C) Lower costs  
D) Better performance  

**Explanation:** Frameworks provide tested implementations of common patterns, reducing development time and complexity while ensuring reliability.

**Question 10:** Which collaboration pattern involves agents working on different aspects simultaneously?  
A) Parallel Processing âœ…  
B) Hierarchical Teams  
C) Debate and Consensus  
D) Sequential Processing  

**Explanation:** Parallel processing involves multiple agents working simultaneously on different aspects of a problem, enabling faster overall completion.

**Question 11:** When would you choose bare metal Python implementation over frameworks?  
A) Enterprise integration  
B) Production applications  
C) Team collaboration projects  
D) Learning fundamentals and custom research âœ…  

**Explanation:** Bare metal implementation provides complete control and understanding of underlying mechanisms, making it ideal for learning and custom research.

**Question 12:** The reflection pattern typically involves how many phases?  
A) 2 phases: Generate and Reflect  
B) 4 phases: Generate, Reflect, Refine, Validate  
C) 5 phases: Generate, Reflect, Refine, Test, Deploy  
D) 3 phases: Generate, Reflect, Refine âœ…  

**Explanation:** The core reflection pattern involves generating initial output, reflecting on quality, then refining based on critique - three essential phases.

**Question 13:** What makes ADK particularly suitable for enterprise applications?  
A) Fastest execution speed  
B) Built-in security, monitoring, and Google Cloud integration âœ…  
C) Open source licensing  
D) Simplest learning curve  

**Explanation:** ADK provides enterprise features like security, compliance, monitoring, and cloud-native integration, making it suitable for business applications.

**Question 14:** In multi-agent systems, what is the role of a "Manager Agent"?  
A) Store data and state  
B) Provide user interface  
C) Coordinate worker agents and manage interactions âœ…  
D) Execute all tasks directly  

**Explanation:** Manager agents orchestrate team activities and handle inter-agent communication, coordinating the work of specialized worker agents.

**Question 15:** Which pattern would be most appropriate for a task requiring real-time stock price analysis?  
A) Multi-Agent (for collaboration)  
B) Reflection (for self-improvement)  
C) Tool Use (for accessing live data APIs) âœ…  
D) Planning (for multi-step workflows)  

**Explanation:** Real-time stock analysis requires accessing external APIs for current market data, making Tool Use the most appropriate pattern for this scenario.
