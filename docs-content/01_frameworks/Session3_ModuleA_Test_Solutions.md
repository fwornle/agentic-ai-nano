## Advanced Orchestration Patterns - Answer Key

**Question 1:** Correct Answer: c) Task complexity, resource availability, and interdependency scores  

**Explanation**: The workflow mode selection algorithm evaluates multiple factors:  
- **Task complexity score > 0.8** AND **CPU > 0.7** → parallel mode  
- **Interdependency score > 0.6** → sequential mode (prevents conflicts)  
- **Moderate conditions** → adaptive mode (balances efficiency and coordination)  

This multi-factor approach ensures optimal resource utilization while respecting task dependencies.

**Question 2:** Correct Answer: b) Conditional proceed with timeout protection  

**Explanation**: The adaptive synchronization policy handles different completion levels:  
- **100% completion** → immediate progression ("proceed_to_merge")  
- **75% completion** → conditional advancement with timeout ("conditional_proceed")  
- **< 75% completion** → continue waiting ("continue_waiting")  

The 75% threshold balances completion requirements with practical timeout considerations.

**Question 3:** Correct Answer: a) Capability match (40%) + Performance score (40%) + Resource efficiency (20%)  

**Explanation**: The composite scoring algorithm weights three factors:
```python
composite_score = (
    capability_match * 0.4 +      # How well capabilities align
    performance_score * 0.4 +     # Historical success rate
    resource_efficiency * 0.2     # Computational efficiency
)
```

This weighting prioritizes capability alignment and proven performance while considering resource optimization.

**Question 4:** Correct Answer: b) Quality score (70%) + Time factor (30%)  

**Explanation**: The intelligent research merging uses quality-weighted integration:
```python
time_factor = 1.0 / (1.0 + execution_time / 60)  # Prefer faster execution
weight = quality_score * 0.7 + time_factor * 0.3
```

This approach prioritizes result quality while rewarding efficient execution, creating balanced weighting for synthesis.

**Question 5:** Correct Answer: c) Research focus, depth level, data sources, and fact checking  

**Explanation**: Research specialist agents receive domain-specific configuration:  
- **research_focus**: Target domain (technical, market, competitive)  
- **depth_level**: Investigation thoroughness (standard, comprehensive)  
- **data_sources**: Preferred information sources  
- **fact_checking_enabled**: Accuracy verification requirements  

These parameters optimize research agents for specific investigation tasks and quality standards.
