# Session 5 Module B - Test Solutions

## Enterprise PydanticAI - Answer Key

### Question 1: Dependency Injection Design Pattern
A) Singleton pattern with global state  
B) ✅ Protocol-based interfaces with container-managed lifecycles  
C) Static factory methods only  
D) Direct class instantiation  

**Correct Answer: B) Protocol-based interfaces with container-managed lifecycles**

**Explanation**: The enterprise dependency injection system uses protocol-based design for flexibility with centralized service instantiation and management, automatic injection based on type annotations, and easy mocking for testing.

### Question 2: Concurrent Request Processing
A) Sequential processing only  
B) ✅ Semaphore-controlled concurrency with configurable limits and performance tracking  
C) Unlimited concurrent execution  
D) Single-threaded execution with queuing  

**Correct Answer: B) Semaphore-controlled concurrency with configurable limits and performance tracking**

**Explanation**: The ProductionAgent implements sophisticated concurrency management with semaphore control to limit concurrent requests, configurable limits adjustable based on system capacity, and performance tracking that monitors response times and throughput.

### Question 3: Enterprise Security Measures
A) Simple password checking  
B) ✅ JWT token validation, role-based authorization, and audit logging  
C) Basic username verification  
D) No authentication required  

**Correct Answer: B) JWT token validation, role-based authorization, and audit logging**

**Explanation**: The EnterpriseSecurityAgent implements comprehensive security with JWT validation for secure token-based authentication, role-based access control for granular permissions, and comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security event tracking.

### Question 4: Audit Logging Information
A) Only request timestamps  
B) ✅ Complete request/response tracking with user context, performance metrics, and error details  
C) Simple success/failure flags  
D) Database query logs only  

**Correct Answer: B) Complete request/response tracking with user context, performance metrics, and error details**

**Explanation**: The audit system captures comprehensive operational data including full transaction visibility for debugging, user context linking actions to specific users, performance metrics for optimization, and comprehensive failure tracking.

### Question 5: Health Monitoring Dependencies
A) Manual status checks only  
B) ✅ Automated dependency health checks with circuit breaker integration and alert generation  
C) Simple ping tests  
D) Log file analysis only  

**Correct Answer: B) Automated dependency health checks with circuit breaker integration and alert generation**

**Explanation**: The health monitoring system provides comprehensive service oversight with continuous automated monitoring, circuit breaker integration to protect against cascading failures, proactive alert generation, and comprehensive visibility into service relationships.
