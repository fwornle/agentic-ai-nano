# Session 5 Module B - Test Solutions

## Enterprise PydanticAI - Answer Key

**Question 1:** Dependency Injection Design Pattern
A) Protocol-based interfaces with container-managed lifecycles ‚úÖ
B) Singleton pattern with global state
C) Static factory methods only
D) Direct class instantiation
**Explanation**: The enterprise dependency injection system uses protocol-based design for flexibility with centralized service instantiation and management, automatic injection based on type annotations, and easy mocking for testing.

**Question 2:** Concurrent Request Processing
A) Unlimited concurrent execution
B) Semaphore-controlled concurrency with configurable limits and performance tracking ‚úÖ
C) Sequential processing only
D) Single-threaded execution with queuing
**Explanation**: The ProductionAgent implements sophisticated concurrency management with semaphore control to limit concurrent requests, configurable limits adjustable based on system capacity, and performance tracking that monitors response times and throughput.

**Question 3:** Enterprise Security Measures
A) Basic username verification
B) Simple password checking
C) JWT token validation, role-based authorization, and audit logging ‚úÖ
D) No authentication required
**Explanation**: The EnterpriseSecurityAgent implements comprehensive security with JWT validation for secure token-based authentication, role-based access control for granular permissions, and comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security event tracking.

**Question 4:** Audit Logging Information
A) Only request timestamps
B) Simple success/failure flags
C) Complete request/response tracking with user context, performance metrics, and error details ‚úÖ
D) Database query logs only
**Explanation**: The audit system captures comprehensive operational data including full transaction visibility for debugging, user context linking actions to specific users, performance metrics for optimization, and comprehensive failure tracking.

**Question 5:** Health Monitoring Dependencies
A) Automated dependency health checks with circuit breaker integration and alert generation ‚úÖ
B) Manual status checks only
C) Simple ping tests
D) Log file analysis only
**Explanation**: The health monitoring system provides comprehensive service oversight with continuous automated monitoring, circuit breaker integration to protect against cascading failures, proactive alert generation, and comprehensive visibility into service relationships.
