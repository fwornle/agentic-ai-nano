# Session 7 Module A - Test Solutions

## Advanced ADK Integration - Answer Key

**Question 1:** Enhanced Gemini Agent Features  
A) Streaming responses with function calling and model configuration flexibility ‚úÖ  
B) Basic text generation only  
C) Static responses only  
D) Image processing only  
**Explanation**: The enhanced Gemini agent implements advanced features including streaming responses for real-time interaction, function calling capabilities for tool integration, and flexible model configuration for different use cases and performance requirements.

**Question 2:** MCP Service Selection Algorithm  
A) Gemini AI-driven analysis of query content and service capabilities ‚úÖ  
B) Random selection  
C) First available service  
D) Manual configuration only  
**Explanation**: The MCP service orchestrator uses Gemini AI to analyze query content and intelligently match it with appropriate service capabilities, ensuring optimal service selection based on semantic understanding rather than simple routing rules.

B) Short-term memory only  
C) File-based storage only  
D) No memory persistence  
**Explanation**: The advanced memory system supports diverse memory types including conversation history for context continuity, factual memory for information retention, emotional memory for sentiment tracking, and preference memory for personalized interactions.

**Question 4:** Response Relevance Determination  
A) Random scoring  
B) Semantic similarity analysis with configurable relevance thresholds ‚úÖ  
C) Manual relevance assignment  
D) Keyword counting only  


**Explanation**: The enterprise context manager uses sophisticated semantic similarity analysis to determine response relevance, with configurable thresholds that allow fine-tuning of relevance scoring for different domains and use cases.

**Question 5:** Production Integration Features  
A) Persistent memory, context management, error handling, and streaming capabilities ‚úÖ  
B) Basic functionality only  
C) Development features only  
D) Single-user support  
**Explanation**: The advanced ADK integration provides comprehensive production features including persistent memory for conversation continuity, sophisticated context management, robust error handling for reliability, and streaming capabilities for responsive user interactions.
